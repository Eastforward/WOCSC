-_6i1fDrugg,<START> Russia will not help India if India go to war with China or Pakistan  Buying weapons from Russia will not mean anything to Russia
-_6i1fDrugg,<START> Dear sir Im afraid Im unable to agree with some of your  statements Thats not about arguing over some issues its more showing different angles of same thingSay you  mentioned about his tiredness He is over seventyhe is on the verge of war with former colleague is and to some extent his comradeand neighbor too then he flies to Beijing to solve somethingAndthen he is invited as very welcome person very important person and political heavyweightand he is asked to be present atthe opening of Olympic games Are you surprised  when he closes his eyes take some deep breath and that very moment somebody takes a picture of himThen he must to skip rest of ceremonies and run home while expecting to fullfil additional dutiesSo some understanding might be of helpSame about treating Chinese colleague inferiorlyGood politician never has enemies or he does not show thatalso never treats anyone with disrespectTodays enemy of yours may be needy and valuable partnerMay byBut you are not loosing that chance Thats why MrPutin is well respected everywhere
-_6i1fDrugg,<START> The Russians do not need to worry about India looking at Russian territory and saying These lands are historically Indian and we want these lands back but that is not true with China who has already mentioned that part of the Russian Far East was taken from China in an unjust treaty and is historically theirs      Russia is also in a difficult position with China in that Russia is right now isolated in the world and facing a deeper isolation if it invades Ukraine so it needs China    But you can bet that China views Russia as the subordinate in this relationship something that cannot sit well with Putin   At the same time while I think it is important for India to maintain its historical ties with Russia Indias political future lies with the Quad     Russia has given tacit support to Chinas attempts to annex the South China Sea and to eventually annex Taiwan in exchange for Chinas support of Russias potential invasion of Ukraine and its political battle with NATO     Russia needs China right now but is competing directly with China in the former Soviet nations like Kazakhstan etc      They are not natural allies but instead natural rivals
-_6i1fDrugg,<START> Simply  Keep your friends close and your enemy closer  Do not trust russia
-_6i1fDrugg,<START> Question India gives its loyalty to Russia but if India has to go to war with China will Russia give its loyalty to India Whose side do you think Russia will be on My guess is Russia will opt out to defend India and take a neutral position just like India did If the world falls apart who will come to assist India if they need help Russia will never go against China to defend India Be careful of how you choose your friends because they can easily become your enemy
-_6i1fDrugg,<START> China wants to be Totalitarian Master of the planet putting Russia at the rear of ever decision Surely Putin knows this

-_6i1fDrugg,<START> Putin has a war to plan
-_6i1fDrugg,<START> Not even can come between Russia and India Time tested friendship No hidden agenda in the friendship
-_6i1fDrugg,<START> Amazing that Putin can be friends with China and India 2 great countries how can that be seen as a negative
-_6i1fDrugg,<START> What it really tells you is that both China and Russia put themselves before all others including their so called partners
-_6i1fDrugg,<START> Putin makes bold statements with sheets of silence
