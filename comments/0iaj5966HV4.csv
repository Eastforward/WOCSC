0iaj5966HV4,<START> Micro concussions from moving the head too quickly are a thing Well that explains a lot All that headbanging I did to heavy metal music in the 90s is haunting me now
0iaj5966HV4,<START> Going for a stroll you experience variations in g force throughout the step Standing still you experience 1g
0iaj5966HV4,<START> I am 4 Seconds into the Video Isnt every Winter Sport a sliding Sport
0iaj5966HV4,<START> All the sports is dangerous so if you dont want expose dont play Its so easy
0iaj5966HV4,<START> Im tryna get some sled head ya feel me
0iaj5966HV4,<START> Adding some or better suspension to a bob sleigh should be relatively easy and even trivialDoing the same to a luge will be tricky As for the skeleton There is just not enough place for one
0iaj5966HV4,<START> 040 I have those  and never did the sport
0iaj5966HV4,<START> Now lets research why its so boring
0iaj5966HV4,<START> So why are we facilitating this madness Isnt the solution super simple Just dont go down an ice slide on a small sled while going 120km per hour Ridiculous
0iaj5966HV4,<START> 210 nothing that a juice cleanse and some alkaline water cant solve
0iaj5966HV4,<START> 040 let me guess Youre also experiencing hot flashes and infertility Some people cannot cope with getting older

0iaj5966HV4,<START> All well and good  Start any mitigation with boxing
0iaj5966HV4,<START> Even if u dont win a medal just being there is an achievement Enduring what each sports does to an athletes body definitely something I cant go through
0iaj5966HV4,<START> Nothing seems hidden looks pretty dangerous to me
0iaj5966HV4,<START> Hidden reason not sure how hidden this is Kind of a common sense risk factor Looks like VOX picking the low hanging fruit
0iaj5966HV4,<START> Uh you dont have to call it hidden We KNOW bobsledding is ing dangerous
0iaj5966HV4,<START> I was surprised there was no mention of how sled head looks similar to CTE found in football players  Some CTE sufferers never had terrible concussions  Rather it was the repeated blows to the helmet from hands and elbows etc over time as well as the jarring of the head as the body gets hit
0iaj5966HV4,<START> Wow  I had no clue
