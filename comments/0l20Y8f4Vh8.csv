0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> corona is fa ke bs
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> The beds were made of cardboard for sustainability cough cough 
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> Your channel should be ashamed of not calling this luxuryand by the way no human being is bigger than environment Western media made issues out of beds
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> Important for us I am from  Bangladesh I am ur big fan today
0l20Y8f4Vh8,"<START> Well, I don't care, but it was boring to begin with, but you guys are here to fight, not to play, and I think you can't hold it in corona, you can't move around, you can act like an adult."
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> Good  thoughts   thank you    шка japanese
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> This is the Only Olympics where we got to see the More of the Olympic Village than ever Thank to the YouTube and Instagram
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> Japan did a great job keeping in mind the pandemic sustainability and hospitalitysuch a clean and hygienic environment
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> Great video but obnoxious music
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> There really wasnt any need for the negative  tone  Media portrays the experience to be terrible while it was not
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> What a waste of money and resources for some of the most obscure sports on the planet that nobody actually watches or cares about
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> I think conducting Olympic in  this magnitude in pandemic time possible only because of Japanese discipline and dedicationgreat work 
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> The Olympic village in Vancouver is now rental apartments and privatelyowned condos with various structural problems I am not surprised because I worked on one building for 8months the things I saw during construction were amazing Rushing to get all those buildings done in a flash compromised the final result  I would not recommend buying a condo in the complex Its pretty but
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> I heard they are all getting laid
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> Every single room of those Tokyo bay water front apartments are sold before the Olympic begins those will not be abandoned as they are located in one of the most expensive area of Tokyo
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> I think everyone should appreciate Tokyo2020 during a pandemic crisis Would there be a Olympic or World Record this year if Japan were not able to run the Olympic in this Pandemic time God Bless
0l20Y8f4Vh8,<START> Seriously japanese know how to utilize every resource available  they will use olympic village very wisely
