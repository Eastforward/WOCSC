2HnMZ2dRIbY,<START> Ayumu Hirano Interview original in JapaneseQ How do you feel right nowIt hasnt sunk in yet but this has been my dream since my childhood and it has finally come true I am so happy that I was able to deliver what I have been imagining and training for all this long time and it is amazing that my little brother Kaishu was also there to compete in the Olympics and to share this moment and witness me win It means a lot for both of us brothers and for me it was essential that I was able to deliver all the tricks and excellence I have always wanted to deliver I was not convinced by the score given for my 2nd run but I was able to handle it and have my frustration express itself through my best performance which I am very happy aboutQ So after knowing the score for your 2nd run you were in a mode like youd nail it again whateverWell I would say there was no tension it was rather how do I say this I was in a totally focused state even more so than usual and I was just there determined to deliver all that I am whatever it takes And then it resulted in a perfect clean final run It was really extraordinary to have such an experienceQ This would be your last match with Shaun White What does this Olympics mean to you in that respectShaun has always kept pushing his limit further and further and though he is the oldest in this competition he keeps showing what I have never experienced yet It was truly inspiring I think this Olympic was a big challenge for him too with all whos who in this sport in the final pushing each others limit I am really excited and honored that eventually I could win among these membersQ Any messages for people back in Japan who are overjoyed nowI wouldnt be here without my family friends staff and everyone who has supported me It would be just great if I could give them back anything through my delivering what I have always dreamed of

2HnMZ2dRIbY,<START> Congrats Ayumu Hirano The score for his perfect 2nd run was ridiculously low but he just took it with silent determination and showed again that he was the best by his 3rd run which was again flawless technically the most difficult and even higher than the 2nd run Imagine what his 2nd run score would have been if he were a Smith from the USA
2HnMZ2dRIbY,<START> Big Congratulations Hiranosenshuu
