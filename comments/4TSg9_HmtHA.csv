4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> Whoever predicted that Alina Zagitova would be the official olympic champion after Beijing is a genius
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> Basically organise for a delay on a minors samples and youre good to go
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> So we are looking at 3 different endurance substance found on her samples   Even if 2 out of 3 substances are not banned then isnt it still doping  If that side stresses that Kamila is a minor she shouldnt be competing at WOMENS SINGLES SKATING and instead be retained at junior division should she
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> They are Russian they live in a country with little opportunities most are poor They just dope and lie for a payout its all bribes and corruption its heavily embedded in Russian life Its a normal way they cheat to win And show no remorse
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> What the Americans and Western Europeans will not come up with to take away the welldeserved medals from Russian athletes They even go to falsification and substitution of doping samples At the same time Western and American athletes use doping and steroids in packs
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> Another Colin Powell test tube As usual American and Western European liars replaced the sample of the Russian athlete American and European athletes pumped up with doping steroids cannot compete honestlyThe American press and sports officials use double standards in the case of a positive doping test of Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva and similar cases with athletes from the United StatesThis was written in a material for the sports portal 3 Wire by American journalist Alan Abrahamson who specializes in covering the Olympic GamesIn particular he recalled that about six years ago American gymnast Kristin Sheldibin passed a positive doping test in which an extremely low content of a banned diuretic was recorded It was stated that the substance got into her body with tap water which she drank from the tap without cleaning Then American officials blamed  as in the case of Kamila Valievas breakdown  the whole system for what happened No Abrahamson noted recalling that Sheldibin was not punished in any way and performed at the OIThe journalist also noted that since 2016 at least 25 antidoping investigations have been identified in the United States after which no punishments were applied to athletes and moreover it was not claimed that the antidoping system is under threat Norwegian asthmatics who stamp medals in bundles turn out to be absolutely clean in terms of taking medicationsBy the way do you happen to know why meldonium is not banned in the NHL for which Russian athletes were punished I explain there is no Russian national team in the NHL They wont for example punish the St Louis Blues hockey players for meldonium its not the Russian national team
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> The whole grandfatherdrinking glass BS is more or less identical to the tennis player Mariano Puerto who reached the French Oprn 2005 final lost to Nadal and immediately tested positive for a banned cardiac drug also He appealed claiming claiming he had accidentally ingested trace amounts of it from his wifes wine glass as his wife was on this medication for high blood pressure supposedly Kamila and Co must have been reading from his playbook 
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> American journalist Alan Abrahamson accused his compatriots of a biased approach to the case of Russian figure skater Kamila ValievaAlmost six years ago American gymnast Kristin Sheldibin passed a positive doping test An extremely low content of a banned diuretic was found in it It turned out that the substance got into her body with tap water which she drank directly from the tap Did American officials then blame the whole system as they did in the case of Kamila Talievas breakdown No Abrahamson wrote and added that no punishment was imposed on the athlete and she performed at the Olympic GamesIn the text he noted that since 2016 at least 25 antidumping investigations have been recorded in the United States which ended without punishment
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> Christine Brennan thinks that Russia should be banned from the next two Olympics 2024 Summer Games and 2026 Winter Games  She also thinks Russia needs to be banned from the next few FS world championships as an extra measure Brennan says in her interviews that she believes this evolving scandal may just be the big thing that finally makes the IOC ban Russia  Russia would need nothing short of catastrophic ban across the board in order to finally stop their sanctioned doping practices
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> I dont really understand why everyone is so mad to be honest The investigation has not been completed yet so it is not known whether Valieva is guilty or not These analyses and legal issues will be dealt with over the next months and only then will we know the truth Valieva should take part in the competition and if she is found guilty the medals will be awarded to other prizewinners If she is not guilty then the reward will rightfully remain with her In my opinion it is absurd not to allow Kamila to participate in the Olympics when the investigation has not been completed
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> Putting Russia in charge of Russia What could go wrong 
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> We all know that the other Russian skaters are doping Can someone tell me why you would dope in skating and what they are doping and using for it I am interested What can you dope that is important in figure skating
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> How did this substance magically fly into her system  Best skating quote ever  
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> Thank you for all the updates You are doing such a fantastic and important job these days We can trust your words  cause they come from an interest and love for the sport So thank you for your hard work
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> speaking of hiring a Russian orthodox priest for a Muslim girl and not observing COVID protocols Valieva testing positive for covid would almost be the best solution to this chaos at this point
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> It would be great to see a stand of solidarity for clean sport in the ladies event They should each leave a test sample and hair sample in the kiss and cry to show they believe you should be clean to compete
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> Her results were clean for the  Olympic game And it should be investigation in place why December 2021 testing has brought the results with considerable delay  In any case Kamila is the best and no one can perform better
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> Kamila is surely a brilliant Talent they should give Her a 2 ChanceBest wishes from 
4TSg9_HmtHA,<START> The IOC should Hold the team medal ceremony and give the medals to America and Japan those Athletes should have their moment ROC should have to wait till the case is resolved When the case is resolved if Kamila is found guilty then the US and Japan can get bumped and Canada can get bronze That is the fairest way to handle this Everyone seems to be forgetting that evidence ie positive testis not proof it is evidence Guilt can only be assigned AFTER a trial
