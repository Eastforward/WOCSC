7rOLt30x7nw,<START> Look at the characters on some of your South Korean ID cards South Korea should stop stealing Chinese characters and Confucius from our country There are already Koreans who say that South Korea has a thousandyear cultural history This is a big joke
7rOLt30x7nw,<START> Chinese people rarely use VPN to access YouTube so that Koreans smear China and Chinese culture like crazyFirst with regard to clothing culture China has a large number of historical relics to prove that it is not just your South Koreans who claim that China stealed clothing culture on various platformsSecond North Korean clothing does not mean that you dont see Chinese people wearing it it means that there are no Chinese people wearing itIn addition according to customs import and export data 90 of the Kimchi that you Koreans eat daily are imported from Sichuan China

7rOLt30x7nw,<START> Chinese people dont even care about kimchiIts just side dishIts only Koreans who make a fuss Hanbok is developed from Chinese ancient costume just like kimono But when China showed its ancient clothing in Tang dynasty at the Olympics in 2008 I didnt see Japanese complaining about China taking away their culture South Korea people are being so sensitive Not to mention  there are indeed thousands of Koreans who born in China live in China and shared Korean culture People should respect them about wearing their tradional clothes anywhere anytime
7rOLt30x7nw,<START> South Korea is the real cultural thief Korea displayed the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellation
7rOLt30x7nw,<START> Being a bigger country does not have the right to take away one countrys deep and traditional culture Even though others might think the difference between Chinas culture and Koreas culture is minor each country has been preserving its own unique culture which is clearly different from other countries For Korea Kimchi has been their own unique traditional food that they have been making and consuming from the ancient past and Hanbok was the type of clothing that Koreans have been wearing since the ancient dynasties Though China claimed that introducing Korean culture was just for the Korean Chinese living in China introducing this culture by portraying the general Korean traditional lifestyle as if it is part of Chinas culture seems as if China is taking away every part of Korean culture and showing off to people as if the culture is theirs This action is a big disrespect to one countrys special culture and is regarding all the prolonged history of Korea and the traditional lifestyle Koreans have been keeping as if they were all copied from Chinas cultures To Koreans it is the same as China claiming Americas culture as if it is part of their culture as there are Chinese Americans in China Please dont differentiate each countrys culture and regard it as petty based on how large the country is Koreans are proud of their culture and they do not want to get this taken away in any way or form If China wanted to introduce this tradition they should have introduced the video and hanbok as Korean culture Also how is the popularity of Kpop and Kdramas movies related to this issue The popularity was gained by worldwide peoples positive interest and this is solely focused on China trying to justify their action of regarding Korean tradition as their piece of the culture Hanfu is the copy of Hanbok If you are curious about this fact GOOGLE IT Kimchi is Koreas food and the video that portrayed a family wearing hanbok grabbing hands together portrays the EXACT culture of Korea
7rOLt30x7nw,<START> All my comments under the Korean post have been deleted It seems that Koreans are a kind of extreme perverted patriotic nationalism In order to cover up the truth Koreans will delete information related to relevant facts even their own posts Very despicable and shameful

7rOLt30x7nw,<START> I always wanted to ask you Chinese lol why you are hated by Japanese and Koreas and other neighboring countries so much
7rOLt30x7nw,<START> Koreans are very afraid of being known by the world that the Koreans are one of the 56 ethnic groups in China When their national costume or culture is on the stage in China Koreans dont see it as an honor but seriously hurt their selfesteem Because ancient Korea has always been a territory of China its writing uses Chinese characters and its culture and folk customs are also deeply influenced by China Whether it is food clothing festivals medicine architecture technology it is partially or completely learned from China Even the officials of the Joseon Dynasty were canonized and dismissed by Chinese monarchsHow can Koreans who consider themselves superior now let the world know these historical facts
