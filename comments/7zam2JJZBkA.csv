7zam2JJZBkA,<START> So this is the Xi Jing Ping games   Like it was Putins Sochis games   Interesting The competition was not fierce   Noone else wanted to host it   It is not seen as a very good business decision because of IOCs lack of practicality with regards financial aspects for the games  The IOC needs a paradigm shift and get off its arrogance horse  Make it about the athletes and their achievements and not about leaders and politics  If the Olympics is supposed to be about everybody it should not be about Xi Jing Ping  That defeats the entire notion of the Olympics  Also the final welcoming of everyone means just athletes but no spectators
