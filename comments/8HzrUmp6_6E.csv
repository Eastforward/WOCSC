8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> These two are so unprofessional as commentators and it shows you do not have to be an ahole about someone you do not like
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> HOW DARE THEY  Take it up with the IOC but DO NOT ATTACK A 15 YEAR OLD GIRL
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> Screw these haters Her performance was great
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> have a hard neck
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> Where all of you were at the last Olympics When Simone biles had the same issue and she was called a hero Double standards why Because when US is wrong nobody thinks its bad but when is the enemy of US is all its horrible This is all BS
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> Let her compete everyone should be able to medicate or treat whatever they need to treat its not an easy sport there are a bunch of health risks Sometimes the rules are ridged for a reason but sometimes we have to take a look at the rules and see if that is priority over someones health I dont have full context but I can tell this is drama And I think everyone should be able to compete No matter what they are on Does this give them an unfair competitive advantage you be the judge of that of course they can still have regulations but its not like she was on something bad Maybe the substance can impair them thats on the person who decides to take it or the persons who requires it
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> Good luck young lady but your name will always be associated with doping Nothing new for Russian athletes
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> Why cant therr be a ceremony for the real winners and kick her out
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> If a microdose of a med taken several weeks ago were still producing some kind of advantage wouldnt it still be in her system Yet all her tests since then have been clean Theres more to this story and judgment should be withheld
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> Why Simona Biles crap at the Olympics because the evil Japanese forbade her to drink magic pills
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> There is so much hate and angry comments here it breaks my heart People rush to post hurtful words without understanding the bigger picture and why Kamila was allowed to compete and what it means Kamila had a microdose in her December 25 2021 test All of her other tests before and after that day were clean including her test at the Europeans in January 2022 and the Olympics in February 2022 In such cases even adult athletes who knowingly took forbidden substance at most get one month suspension  This is exactly what the US runner got when tested positive for a banned substance  1 month suspension If this was the case Kamilas suspension would have been over on January 24 and she still would have been allowed to compete at the Olympics The lab purposely or accidentally held up the test results for nearly 2 months instead of 10 days blaming it on Covid and thus violating Kamilas right to due process and taking away her opportunity to respond Keep in mind that the same lab has successfully processed her and other athletes later tests on time  What if Kamila was banned from competing at the Olympics and it turned out that there was a lab error or a conspiracy She would have suffered an irreparable harm as this could be her one and only chance to compete at the Olympics  That is why she was allowed to compete  I am sure there will be further investigation and if she is indeed found guilty there will be consequences However if she is not guilty she would have her fair chance  And Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir as official commentators should do their homework and attempt to understand what is really going on before casting their uneducated judgemental and narrowminded comments over national TV influencing our viewers  They sound mean dumb  and simply unprofessional
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> NBC Please fire Weir and Lipinski They are such unprofessional hypocrites No one takes their comments seriously anymore
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> She is a disgrace to the sport true Olympic athletes ate pure and accept glory or defeat as long as they are pure and unlike you use drugs
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> there isnt a pill in the world that can make you skate as well as this girl doesi blame the chinese
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> What matters most is if she is under physicians care for treatment of a heart condition Sounds she like could have an arrhythmia mitral valve prolapse or both or or dysautonomia with postural hypotension or tachycardia Many tall thin teens have these She was so good at figure skating at such a young age its hard to imagine any need to use performance enhancing drugs The meds she was accused of only last hours in our systems They are not like anabolic steroids which last months Watch her skate at 5 years old She was amazing even at that young age
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> The American press and sports officials use double standards in the case of the positive doping test of Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva and similar cases with athletes from the United States This was written in a material for the 3 Wire Sports portal by American journalist Alan Abrahamson who specializes in covering the Olympics In particular he recalled that about six years ago American gymnast Kristin Sheldibin passed a positive doping test in which an extremely low content of a banned diuretic was recorded It was stated that the substance got into her body with tap water which she drank from the tap without cleaningAmerican officials then blamed  as they did in the case of Kamila Valievas breakdown  the whole system for what happened No Abrahamson noted recalling that Sheldibin was not punished in any way and she performed at the OI The journalist also pointed out that since 2016 at least 25 antidoping investigations have been identified in the United States after which no punishments were applied to athletes and moreover it was not claimed that the antidoping system is under threat Probably for an exceptional nationTHIS IS DIFFERENT
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> this is bad for the sport and the russians really should be disqualified from competing The excuses dont cut it anymore  We have seen this repeated behaviour and the cheating had been going on since the 60s  How many clean athletes were denied medals due to this illegal behaviourDisgusting
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> These two decided to take the American antiRussian position on this But that wasnt enough for them They continued to dig the knife in this girls back for what seemed like FOREVER throughout not just her skate but also the warmup Hopefully for the free program these two narcissists will pipe it down and let us enjoy this onceinalifetime simply exquisite skaters performance Its interesting to see how the Russians respond to Weir who adores Russian culture and wants to fit in with them so much They should disown him for his cowardly betrayal
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> Boooooooo to her I hope shes ok But definitely booo She must be booing herself
8HzrUmp6_6E,<START> Why is no one posting full routines  Is that on hold till the investigation is over too  I wanna see Papadakis  Cizeron win
