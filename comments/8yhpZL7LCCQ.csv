8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> the IVE situation is just a mess  and her fans are trying to either justify her actions by blaming the company or just denying the clearest situation of favouritism in kpop history  the blame is on her AND the company  and sure dont hate on her  hating on anybody is bad  but it doesnt mean you cant criticize some1 for their bad behavior  and for the ppl saying shes young and got famous young thats why  even suzy didnt act like that even tho she won a deasang at 14  and was called the nations first love at that time 
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> I remember when that first video clip came out They had to clarify it and the explanation was that her contact was falling out or something whether you believe that or not is up to you lol
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> As for numerous teenyoung girls getting along perfectly all the time  never EVER going to be a thing I have 8 sisters We are family I love them Im sure idols truly love their families more than their members despite their members feeling like family maybe But Ive also been so mad at my sisters and felt as if Ive hated some of them too Lol So if thats a possibility between girls who have grown up together as legit family Its DEFINITELY going to happen amongst girls who have NOT grown up together as legit familyAmongst young catty possibly insecure girls insecure people often act out towards others in order to defend and protect those insecurities what they perceive as their weakness girls who are in the midst of literally figuring out real life girls who have possibly spent their past few years actively COMPETING AGAINST others who are may now be their group members girls who have spent the past few years purposely trying to outshine the next trainee girl So imagine that Thats what theyve been doing for years then suddenly theyre paired up made to live in CLOSE and not very private quarters and then theyre told to act as if theyre all just the closest of friends that is something extremely unrealistic dont you thinkSo of course there MAY or MAY NOT be feuds or little bits of dislike amongst them There may even be real HATE and ill will wished upon eachotherWe as the fans are never supposed to know But I believe we as the fans should ALWAYS have that reality in our minds and to FORGIVE SMALL things like this  which we dont even KNOW FOR SURE OR NOT is even actual dislike between members We shouldnt blow them out of proportion we could only possibly make the situations between them worse And as a true fan of anything or anyone you would never want to cause such a strife amongst people you support and like and wish the greatest of success for Although we should hold accountable those that bully and purposely hurt others blatantly But little side glances we know no backstory about Forget it and move on Its nothing Just know that it MIGHT maybe could be something small between them but that should stay private between them to work out Its not for us fans to bash or to tell someone to apologize or change their attitudes when we have no real idea of whats actually happening AOA situation for instanceAs for homegirls stank face at the other girlIve personally have FELT my face make the wrong sort of looks before towards people due to maybe not feeling well or internally being upset  and then someone around me makes a joke and I attempt to laugh or smile a bit yet my upset or uneasy feeling immediately comes back over that fake light laughsmile causing my face to feel more as if Im scowling imagine your happy smiling face immediately going to an expression of upset or unease inbetween those expressions it could easily appear to be a scowl or a mean face Just my thoughts on that
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> Ok so as a Chinese person I kinda want to clarify somethings Disclaimer Im not an expert I just wanna provide some background infoFirst of all  the whole war of China stealing Korean is just kinda ridiculous in my opinion Obviously its wrong of China to say that kimchi and hanbok is theres since they have their own food and clothes But it should be acknowledged that they were neighboring countries in the ancient times so some aspects of culture are similar such as the clothingSecond the whole biased judging during the Olympics is not as uncommon as yall think The clip in this video does show the Chinese skater pushing the Korean skater and I think it looks deliberate But Sk skaters had done the same thing so like Also biased judging happens all the thing so u cannot expect the judges to be completely fair but I do agree if the athletes have violated rules then they should be disqualified penalized Lastly I just wanna say that ppl should be able to support the athlete they want If the athlete have done something wrong then sure u can inform the person it Hate comments r too much and whoever sends those are just xssholes with too much free time
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> abt the wonyoung thing i dont stan the group or izone so im not trying to be biased but why are the clips of her being rude like 5 seconds each and thats it people tell idols to be honest and stuff but when 2 idols have a fight or something which is normal they should act happy it annoying im not gonna sit here an act like a girl is a bitch because of 5 second clips esp when we dont know anything about her or the group which i bet worked hard to be where they are now but i just hope they all work together well
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> Poor ningning
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> Wow how did that chines skater not get disqualified I found that rlly unfair bc he obviously pushed the Korean skater and its against the rules This shows that they dont look nor judge correctly
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> ok wtf Wonyoung needs to mature up she sure is preety she cant stand anyone take her spotlight she always been a preety girl so that got in her head and on their m countdown thing after they won the prize idols usually sing live Wonyoung being an idol for 3 years fking lip synced while her group mate Liz who just debuted is singing live perfectly Wonyoung doesnt have any EXTRAORDINARY skills she has ok dance skills her vocals are ok and her rap is ok its just average its just her visual and yujin has gotten way better stage precense then her also mnet rigging her as the center LMFAOOOO it just makes me annoyed how she cant respect other she is 17 gonna be 18 and their are idols younger and same age as her they have never acted like this so I wont listen to any of your bs knetz just ignore her plastic surgery which completely changed her and hate on aespa members for their plastic surgery double standards be like
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> No offense to woonyoung but all I see is a pretty face with bamboo arms and legsI feel like shes getting thinner and thinner each day hope its not something related to health issue 
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> Well haters hating on Namjoon can hurt him but maybe he already knew this is going to happen before he posted it he saw it coming Well haters are not going to bring them down or something they are BTS LIKE THE BANGTAN BOYS they are at the top of the game and so it doesnt matter Armys lets not give too much attention to these hatersBTS is internationally famous and some few fans leaving wont make a big difference But it is kind of worrying for aespa and ningning because they have just debuted and most of their album sales and fans are from korea and china soo it can cause a little damage to them well
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> some cnetz and some knetz equally both need therapy fr
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> Im sorry but what do expect from China
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> Namjoon and Ningning receiving backlash for being proud Korean and Chinese rootingcongratulating is making me feel frustrated to some people
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> Basically the Chinese netizens are claiming that the Korean athlete that RM supported was a cheaterIve tried looking into this and cant find anything to support this claim But I guess thats why they mad at him
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> Im not even going to touch the Olympics however I will say we all need to be showing more love and support for each other But you look gorgeous love how you do your makeup and different styles 
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> I dont believe the Wonyoung and Yujin thing because they have so many vids together talking and laughing they have the closest friendship in IVE too
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> China played dirty
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> This years Olympics is a joke
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> Thanks to high speed camera  No more cheatinghttpswwwyoutubecomshortsj4ECSTGfnlw     Hungary South Korea foul  Look at the truth
8yhpZL7LCCQ,<START> That push from the Chinese skater was so on purpose there definitely is a big bias
