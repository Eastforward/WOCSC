9A1BQRllQgc,<START> Doping queen 
9A1BQRllQgc,<START> I will write this comment everywhere maybe then people will think and they will not take on faith everything that the propaganda media says without hesitationAnd how do Americans all so honest who are for honest sports feel about the fact that their athletes drink drugs saying that a doctor prescribed it to them But wait legal or not you drink drugs that make you stronger and you win but WADA says its all right its legal Is it fair to other athletes who come out already knowing that you took drugs and they wont beat you No its as unfair as doing it covertly but you keep doing it and its no less depressing for your opponents You are talking about honesty and fairness but are you honest yourself after the whole world learned last year that many athletes from the US and other countries are taking drugs that are banned by WADA After the sanctions of Japan last year Biles showed a poor result without her drugs refused to continue she proved by this that they helped her to take high places Lets take all her medals just like everyone who drinks drugs even if its for health It will be honest and fair if the sick will perform in the Paralympic sport and not with healthy ones And its too cunningly they came up with someone who has a migraine she drinks medicine for migraine but it increases her physical data Is it fair No In such rules there is no honesty and integrity I wont be surprised if all countries have their own laboratories that make new drugs that are not on the WADA list Im sure Why before Sochi Russians were not caught so often on drugs and after Sochi Russians all decide to actively drink them This is strange very strange I wonder which country will be the culprit of such scandals next Which country will stand in the way of the United States to medals  if the world still remains as it is nowI read an interesting comment from Steve here If she is exempt from being accused of doping because she is minor she should not be allowed to compete because she is minor I wrote about patients who drink drugs so I want to paraphrase Steves statement If patients are exempt from doping charges because they are sick they should not be allowed to compete because they are sick Fair enough Honestly It is necessary to take all the medals from S Biles asthmatics from Norwegians and other sick athletes from the USA and other countriesIf you have written the rules then follow them or do not write anything at all openly say that the USA is an exceptional nation and it allows drugs to those who obey them Hypocrites

9A1BQRllQgc,<START> The test sample was collected during incompetition on Christmas day but the result was not released until the 8 febIts timed to do damage to her careerSimilar tactics were used to prevent another athlete Sun Yang from paticipating in the Olympic games
9A1BQRllQgc,<START> Why IOC didnt ban Kamila immediately if she tested positive Why IOC didnt release full story The testing was routine checkup randomly in last December Kamilas urine was sent to Sweden for testing Why the testing result was just released on Feb 09 after nearly 2 months Just after ROC got the gold medal of womens figure skatting team very suspicious
9A1BQRllQgc,<START> The framing of Russia by the US and its right arm WADA is clear here both in the timing of the disclosure of the positive test result and the media chorus which came after it Let it be made clear that RUSADA sent Kamila Valievas blood sample to Sweden for testing on the 25th of December and that the laboratory in Sweden had a time limit of 20 days to return the result according to WADA regulations Why did it take 45 days for the ITA to return the result and why did they time the disclosure of the positive test result to coincide with the exact moment of the medal presentation ceremony for maximum media coverage Besides two positive test results are needed to confirm a banned substance offence since the test itself has a margin of error In this case we have only one and only a trace was found Here we are talking about an expired sample and a frame up and this case should be dismissed immediately As for Moscows doping history you just need to check the annual number of doping cases in Russia as compared to other major countries like the US and the UK for example and you will see that the number of annual doping cases in the UK and US by far surpass those of Russia So it is legit to question why the US and UK teams have never been sanctioned like Russia has
