B729Zq__YH4,<START> Once you set your mind into not purchasing anything from China two things happen You get to see products from other countries and those products are a better quality I keep a record of everything I buy My major purchases this year were an electric Toro lawnmower from Mexico I only buy clothing now from America Malaysia Vietnam Thailand or India The car parts I bought were made in Mexico The lawn care products I bought were from the EU Any food products I buy never come from China under any circumstances I purchase food products from Korea Japan and Thailand I buy Canadian wines as well as Australian African French Spanish and Chilean I will only buy seafood products that are frozen from Thailand Chile Argentina and Peru Of course Im a big fan of grass fed beef from Alberta wild caught salmon from the Waters of British Columbia as well as crab and clams Are you getting to see the picture yet There is nothing in my shopping list that has China written on it I check every label and every product I buy to ensure that does not happen The other day I went to buy some instant noodles that had a picture of a Korean flag on the front of it and Korean lettering Naturally I made the assumption it was a Korean product I didnt pay much attention to the products in my shopping bag until I started thinking about it Something did not feel right about the instant noodles so I looked very carefully at the packaging Low and behold The packaging led me to believe it was Korean when it was really Chinese I instantly took it back and threw it back on the shelf searched the other noodles and found both Korean and Japanese noodles which I purchased Its so easy not to buy products from China You just have to check everything that you buy because they make every attempt to pass it off as a product produced in another country And again the most amazing thing is the fact that within just a few minutes you realize that what you bought that was not made in China is a far better quality The Nike shoes that I wear lasted forever when they were made in Vietnam The same shoe made in China starts squeaking just days after purchasing them because the glue they used inside was substandard and broke away from the main body of the shoe I had purchased six pairs because I cant my size or this quality of shoe in China The sports shop had to go through their inventory to find me six new pairs of Nike runners that were made in Vietnam

B729Zq__YH4,<START> Crimes against humanity in Afghanistan Iraq Libya and Syria are indisputable whereas those against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang are just alleged and have yet to be verified Also the Muslim countries including Saudi Arabia the UAE and Indonesia and Malaysia dont accept these allegations invented by Adrian Zenz and the NEDCIAUSA The US is again weaponising human rights and democracy to invent excuses to go to war with another country this time with China Look at your own human rights abuses both abroad and at home before accusing China hypocrites
B729Zq__YH4,<START> How about Julian Assange and Edward Snowdon huh Feng Shuais personal mistake in having an affair with a married man is not a global issue Afterall shecis a mature 30 year old not a teenager Human rights issues in Xinjiang are all made up lies anyway
B729Zq__YH4,<START> This is not new and the USA is in the habit of blaming other countries for various reasons while it itself is guilty of similar offences  Asian and Black Lives Matter  
B729Zq__YH4,<START> China won the chicken game Diplomatic Boycott means almost nothing  for China
