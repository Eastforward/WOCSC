BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> The Olympics should be fair and should keeps its integrity
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> I dont really understand why everyone is so mad to be honest The investigation has not been completed yet so it is not known whether Valieva is guilty or not These analyses and legal issues will be dealt with over the next months and only then will we know the truth Valieva should take part in the competition and if she is found guilty the medals will be awarded to other prizewinners If she is not guilty then the reward will rightfully remain with her In my opinion it is absurd not to allow Kamila to participate in the Olympics when the investigation has not been completed
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> SHE SHOULDNT BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE RUSSIA HAS BEEN BANNED FOR MASSIVE DOPING AND BRIBING IOC OFFICIALS WITH SUITCASES FULL OF CASH  THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT IS DEAD
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> Where there is smoke there is  fire Ooh
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> She needs to step down
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> The medicine in her system was hardly a PED Get over it Youre destroying the Olympics with this nonsense
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> Time to do away with these Olympics they suck and no longer bring any pleasure
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> Kamila left all emotions on the ice and took the lead in the short program   Russian figure skaters are not subject to pressure The Olympic Games in Beijing which our skaters have been dreaming about for the past four years have turned from a holiday into a nightmare  
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> What yall mad about  She is skating clean at the games and her new tests are clean whats the issue She came out positive months ago and she would have still made the roc team without the drugs People are acting as if she still have drugs in her system  Sorry but she is too far ahead of the rest of the girls She doesnt need drugs to cheat  This is just pure jealousy Its a damn heart medication yall acting like its some hardcore drugs
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> We test for a reason  So why test if no enforcement or punishment
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> What substance can make an ice skater better Aderall  Is pure te technique
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> Yes shes only 15 But she should know better than that Valieva dont you feel ashamed to be part of the competition Because I do IOC is punishing the REAL medalists because of her WOW
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> the timing is impeccablecorrupted WADA attempt to sabotage her just in time after she got gold medal and hours before team medals ceremony was heldimagine you are clean 2 months before olympics then before and during Beijing olympics and suddenly you are notthis is just another SJW witch huntUSA really doesnt want to see Russia in olympicsBeijing olympics officials decided she is clean before and during the event and may resume her competitionthe arbitrary court decided she can resume her competition and rejected WADA IOC and friends for her suspensionWADA failed to deliver the positive doping result which was negative it took them two months and they waited for the athlete to get gold medal and her team to win the team event before they deliver the positive resultthe arbitrary court literally call WADA incompetent for their jobWADA use COVID and lack of staff as an excuse for their incompetentand WADA didnt defend themselves they settled being called incompetent rather than called for attempt on sabotage of an athleteWADA doesnt want to get investigated by any chance if Russia sue them for sabotage attempt on Kamila Valieva which Russia should so WADA stay putWADA attempt on the sabotage failed leaving only IOC International olympics comittee and friendsIOC and friends didnt stop there they still fighting not to give medals so they came up with thishalf of the olympics sponsors are US companies Visa Airbnb Proctor  Gamble CocaCola and with the last one Intel Corp
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> Ask the Holy Spirit to convict people of the sin of not believing in Jesus John 1689 and guide Christians into all truth John 1613
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> Lol yall calling her cheater but you dont realize she has no competition from outside countries only her domestic rivals she is that good and doesnt need any boosters to win an olympic gold so her doping incident must be accident not intentional btw it was couple months ago now her system is clean you guys do not realize she is the talent born once in a decade
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> O heahh She is piece of 
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> I dont get it So one athlete cheats and less is punished What about all the CLEAN athletes who tried their best for this Olympic game The IOC needs to admit that to be fair for every athlete she shouldnt have been qualified They are messing up the Olympic games
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> Even if she gets disqualified it warms my heart knowing no medals will go to the USA since they perform so bad in womens FS
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> were trying to buy some time until we can figure out a way to award the medal to her on technicality
BHNb8Grvf1E,<START> Why should other CLEAN athletes be robbed of their olympic experience to accommodate a cheater
