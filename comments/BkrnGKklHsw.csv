BkrnGKklHsw,<START> Doping of WariewaThe medicine used by my grandfather is mixed explained by a lawyerThe apology is unreasonableIts impossible for a 15yearold girl to mistakenly take her grandfathers medicineThe Russian side would have given it to drink as usual to strengthen the playersTo be honest it doesnt matter whether the drug that reacts with doping is mixed in or whether it is intentional or not and athletes who give a positive reaction at the Olympic selection can participate
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> This is absolutely a performanceenhancing drug my response is long but its the medical facts of why
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> Disgusting state sponsored cheaters  IOC is so corrupt  Russia should be banned from the Olympics
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> russia has still not learnt from its previous state sponsored doping scandals
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> Russia was given a chance after MASSIVE cheating in Sochi  clearly nothing has changed  Time to ban them indefinitely  They shouldnt get to ruin yet another Olympics  And whoever gave Valieva this BANNED substance should no longer be allowed in any sport or around any children EVER again
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> Just disgusted No Russian can be trusted Im finished with the Olympics Boo her off the ice 
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> According to the CAS athletes under 16 like Valieva have more rights under antidoping rules and typically arent held responsible for taking banned substances The focus of any future investigation will home in on her personal team  coaches doctors nutritionists etc   The panel considered that preventing the athlete to compete at the Olympic Games would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances CAS Director General Matthieu Reeb saidThis appears to be another chapter in the systematic and pervasive disregard for clean sport by Russia US Olympic and Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland said in a statementMinors have more rights    The Russians will now use this decision in the future for all their athletes under 16
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> If she was disqualified the US would have won I wonder where these accusations come from
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> DOPE DOPE DOPE  Russians are famous for it but any ways they can compete
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> America does not know what kind of dirty trick to do to Russia
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> And this is one of why I am not watching the olympics along with the despicable CCP you got the Russian cheaters being allowed to competeWhat a joke
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> no need to rejoice that she is taking part in the competition 15 years old and doped she will keep this reputation forever  What will happen to her in competition in the future  what do its Russian competitors who respect the laws of competition think  that she won the Russian championship by cheating  Poor child this competition is only the beginning of the problems and for those around him too  Only his youth saved him she was not whitewashed allowed to participate and that is the truth and that is what the world will remember
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> Russian Hucksterism at its best Nice try Putin Lackeys
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> Someone should tell her that despite her dumb dream that she is still a child not an adult
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> OI OI OI  The people that are talking about her better shut the fuck up unless its good shit cuz I have a knife Shes the victim here and shes such a loveball such a sweetheart people better not fucking forget that 
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> Everything in Vlads Russia is a lie
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> Pushing drugs onto Russian athletes is approved and even encouraged by the Kremlin Has been for many years Putin is perfectly aware it is going on These young girls have a very short sports career and are burnt out physically and mentally by the time they are 18 They are put under enormous psychological pressure to perform and win Valievas coach already has younger girls ready to replace her It is basically a racket in child exploitation
BkrnGKklHsw,<START> WADA What corrupted regulators
