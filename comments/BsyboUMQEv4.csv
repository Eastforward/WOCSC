BsyboUMQEv4,<START> Jonathan and Sandra just vibing as artists I love it Sandras comments connecting the Valieva scandal to SLC were very illuminating Fans have been screaming about the corruption in scoring for years and get gaslit by people in the sport When is the sport going to admit theres a problemI was so happy to see HD skate so well and win a medal You have to just fall in love with their skating whenever they have a halfdecent program A few errors but I guess thats part of just going for it the way they did They deserve to be remembered as a great team
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> Love the sweater
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> Sandra bezic is an honest woman  and we all need more honest people in our lives
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> I dont know how anybody else feels but I really like the Armenian team and thought they were a little underscored Thank you Dave Jonathan Sandra
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> The sweater Dr Spletnikov lol 
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> This was a great recap  I really enjoyed such a positive show about a really good dance event I thought it was refreshing to see commentators speak more bluntly I thought Scott Moir was a standout  not only did we get some of those blunt comments that gave us a few chuckles but I also really learned something about how to look at ice dance from his comments about the Italians knee bend or the program composition of Vicky and Nicky and that whacky Riverdance section
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> dr shvetsky was lurking around at the dance event too no words lol
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> Their last minute should have taken them off of the podium Love Sandra
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> Watching Sandra watching Dave getting all breathy and imitating her I love it
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> I still think Chalk and Bates had the best free skate by far and should have been on the podium They are undoubtedly the most creative ice dance couple with the most dance ability flow and connection on the ice
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> Seeing you both with Sandra is the best thing thats happened in the last two days Thank you
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> Dear TSL thank you so very much for keeping the world informedSandra you are a joy so insightful and knowledgeable thank you for your thoughts and grounding usRe Doping  Im not going to mention Valieva specifically here because I do not believe for one moment that she is the only skater from Russia affected by abuse or controlled Doping But consider this  instead if having protected persons due to being minors change the minimum age of competitors to exclude minors ie raise the minimum age of competitors to prevent this type of farce in future   These children are exactly that  CHILDREN They are being abused by doping damage to their bodies broken bones delayed puberty poor nutrition and dehydration   Thats one thing for a Survivalist on exercise not the doping obviously but theyre adults who have trained and prepared for the rigours of survival expedition and come to that place as an adult making an informed decisionTLDR change minimum age to prevent minors protected persons competing thus ensuring athletes are responsible participantsPC  RD was the most sublime dance Ive ever seenSK  the RD didnt have anything remotely related to HipHop and literally no choreography   The FD was blasphemy to music Boring and forgettableHD  I was so impressed by both programs  and that lift OMGCD  RD wasnt anything special  The FD has grown on me as the season has progressed  If I had watched it for the first time at the Olympics I wouldnt have understood itSD  phenomenal  Just phenomenal FearGibson RD was good  FD  they missed a trick Vogue would have been such an Olympic moment  but Lion King didnt hold my attention  Not that it was bad it wasnt but Madonna would have been phenomenalHawayekBaker  My favourite US team  When will they be marked appropriately They are always so underscoredGuinardFabri  The RD was cheesy but I did love the lift where she struck the MJ poses   He always appears too small for her and Im always amazed at their lifts
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> youd have to think that if the USA presses charges against Eteri or anyone else involved she wouldnt be able to step foot in the US or any country with an  extradition treaty with the US Thats a considerable number of countries where competitions could be held
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> Scandal in 1972 was Trixi Schuba winning with a boring poor long program because of her lead in figures therefore women who could really skate such as Janet Lynn  fall or no fall and Karen Magnussen didnt stand a chance Therefore I believe the next year the ISU  brought in the short program
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> My 2 moments in for this event were also SD and PC That Zorro program is going to be a guilty pleasure that Ill go back and watch over and over again Yes its cheesy but Im just such a sucker for that For PC I didnt love their FD all season but for some reason in Beijing there was a sudden moment of clarity in their FD where everything clicked for me When I need a good cry Ill be going back to the PC FD againTotally agreed about the IAM skaters each of them are presented in the best way possible drawing on all of their own unique strengths and none of them look like the other teams That in itself is an incredible feat Much love and respect for this school in Montreal
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> You guys are amazing Thank you for giving us some fair but clear words of truth these days
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> 2430  Jonathan
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> Thank you for this Dave and Jonathan As a long time figure skating fan  the decision to allow Valieva to skate was a huge blow to clean sport and I just feel gutted It was so refreshing to hear Sandras take on the recent events While I heavily considered not watching the Womens SP earlier today I ended up watching and not sure why I bothered since I was left feeling angry on how it played out
BsyboUMQEv4,<START> I am glad that all of you are getting profits I mean money from the tragedy of a fifteen years old
