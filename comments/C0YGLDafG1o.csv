C0YGLDafG1o,<START> I believe Taiwan should reunify with China however instead of China taking Taiwan Taiwan should take China just like in the pre 1949 days if thats possible if not I gladly support their independence I dont want the Communist China to take Taiwan because imo it could ruin the culture which is Chinese culture after all but was destroyed in China thanks to Mao Zedong and potentially make living there more restricted with dwindling freedom to do basically anything And if Hong Kong ever got its independence it should strengthen its ties with the Republic of China Taiwan that is and free itself from the restrictions that the CCP imposes of them If the ROC finally takes back China I hope they remove these restrictions and become as open as possible with the rest of the world while also keeping the party that makes Taiwan what it is right now thats what I think a unified China should look like If thats impossible then I at least hope they stay away from the CCP as long as they can
