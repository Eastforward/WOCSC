C4cWk_nP0Xc,<START> As he sat on the Mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately saying Tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age And Jesus answered them See that no one leads you astray For many will come in my name saying I am the Christ and they will lead many astray And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars See that you are not alarmed for this must take place but the end is not yet For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places All these are but the beginning of the birth pains Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death and you will be hated by all nations for my names sake And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray And because lawlessness will be increased the love of many will grow cold But the one who endures to the end will be saved And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come Matthew 24314But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies then know that its desolation has come near Luke 2120So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place Matthew 2415Forces from him will arise desecrate the sanctuary fortress and do away with the regular sacrifice And they will set up the abomination of desolation And by smooth words he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant but the people who know their God will be strong and take action Daniel 113132 And from the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up there will be 1290 days Daniel 1211 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath For then there will be great tribulation such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now no and never will be And if those days had not been cut short no human being would be saved But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short Matthew 241622Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens will be shaken Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other Matthew 242931Because you have kept the word of My perseverance I also will keep you from the hour of testing that hour which is about to come upon the whole world to test those who dwell on the earth I am coming quickly hold fast what you have so that no one will take your crown Revelation 31011But we do not want you to be uninformed brothers and sisters about those who are asleep so that you will not grieve as indeed the rest of mankind do who have no hope For if we believe that Jesus died and rose from the dead so also God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus For we say this to you by the word of the Lord that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ will rise first Then we who are alive who remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so we will always be with the Lord 1 Thessalonians 41317But concerning that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven nor the Son but the Father only For as were the days of Noah so will be the coming of the Son of Man For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day when Noah entered the ark and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away so will be the coming of the Son of Man Then two men will be in the field one will be taken and one left Two women will be grinding at the mill one will be taken and one left Therefore stay awake for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming Matthew 243642Know this first of all that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking following after their own lusts and saying Where is the promise of His coming For ever since the fathers fell asleep all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation 2 Peter 334For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world but that the world might be saved through Him He who believes in Him is not judged he who does not believe has been judged already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God This is the judgment that the Light has come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the Light for their deeds were evil For everyone who does evil hates the Light and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed But he who practices the truth comes to the Light so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God John 31621Repent now of all your sins get away from all sins and abide in the Savior and Lord Jesus the Christ Yeshua the Messiah with all your heart for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
