CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> It seems like the reporter she didnt like going to China and doing her report work theremost of her opnions were biased or negativeso the question is wheres the other place this big event could be held otherwise beijing in this particular covid situation nowplease show some respect to the all the athletes all the hard workers and whoever has contributed to this event
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Im outraged that the host was not triple masked Double masking is only twice as effective Shes literally murdering people by not triple masking So selfish
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> phony commie wanna be 
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Boycott the communist games Thank you China for working with Fauci to produce the virus
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> olympics jumped the shark and covids a scam
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> TOO fucking funny The ad is whining about carbon footprints and then the video show endless waste being created by the covid insanity
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Irony is this is exactly how the non gentile public figures would prefer it alongside their Covidiots and their face diapers
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Believing china controlled Covid is like believing masks reduce spread
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> N95 only works a tiny bit if professionally fitted It is instantly rendered useless with another mask under it
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> When should we talk about China's consent camps labor camps and child labor about the Beijing regime torture rape murder starvation and dehydration in Chinese jails what about general basic human rights in China Political prisoners in Beijing jails are treated worse than animals What people like Donald Trump are demanding talk about how much China should pay to the world
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> What r the ppe for I thought Chinese people are well vaccinated
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Totalitarian tyrannical dystopian hell hole Why anyone would go to the Olympics after china caused this pandemic is beyond me
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> British boycotts his own singer John Lenon and what a stupid Prime Minister British now has
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Whether the epidemic prevention measures at the Winter Olympic venues are good or not should be based on the feelings of athletes
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> So proud my government takes everything to insure foreigners wont infect us Chinese Keep those crazy foreigners in check Dont let them escape and sneak into the city
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Saint Joseph terror of demons Pray for us
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Pls pray the rosary and devine mercy chaplet to free all countries from war calamities hunger child abuse violence abortion euthanasia divorce pornography prostitution homosexuality drugs violence corruption terrorism addiction slavery  all evilspls pray for peace on all families and homes
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Just from the narrow sense of the Olympic competition it would really be a shame and unfair if a toplevel athlete travels all the way to Beijing only to be infected by COVID and had to miss hisher contest because heshe might be too ill during that period So an Olympic bubble is kind of necessary regardless of where the Olympics take place at this time Tokyo did almost the same last year although it looks like Beijings execution is even better
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> Again its the athletes and coaches themselves that are entering China already infected with Covid  Im happy to see that China has implemented procedures to protect its own people from having this virus spread from the outside  If journalists are so negatively impacted by Chinas rules and constraints then they should have stayed in their own country  The closed loop villages have  been well published and documented worldwide so this shouldnt be a surprise  Follow the rules or just leave
CJuzGF6DCl0,<START> I think he is an impolite and uneducated person
