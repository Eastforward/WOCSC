DpMi03gCNPE,<START> Hopefully Im wrong but Sun Tzu Quote The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself Therefore I believe the CCP may take the worlds athletes hostage at the winter games its already a fully fenced secure compound in exchange of a peaceful hand over of Taiwan or at least allows CCP to attack Taiwan without outside support for Taiwan
