Fht5z9YX_pI,<START> Camila left all emotions on the ice and took the lead in the short program  Russian figure skaters are not subject to pressure The Olympic Games in Beijing which our skaters have been dreaming about for the past four years have turned from a holiday into a nightmare  Instead of discussing the genius of our athletes all over the world they are talking about the doping scandal with Valieva  It affected not only Kamil but also the rest of our girls  Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova The Russians performed under the most severe pressure  But they endured it Valieva made a small mistake on the triple axel but she skated so soulfully that she didnt leave her competitors a chance  Trusova did not change herself and again took the risk  Shcherbakova on the other hand deliberately made the program easier and did not fail Russian figure skaters on the way to the Russian podium The Georgian Russian woman kept in the lead for a long time The first warmups are often ignored by even the most dedicated figure skating fans  Usually the athletes there are weak making mistakes even on the simplest jumps  At the Olympics the trend has not changed but there were surprises from the first performances  Ukrainian Anastasia Shabotova went on a triple axel but didnt twist it and fell and then the whole program fell apart for the girl  The Japanese Mana Kawabe was the next to venture but she also failed in the ultradifficult jump  Nevertheless she was able to take the lead in the first group of participants In the second warmup the representative of Georgia Anastasia Gubanova impressed with a sensual and heartfelt performance  The figure skater did an excellent job with the content from the cascade of flip toolups double axel and triple lutz and for a long time entrenched herself in the lead with 6540 points Mariah Bell tried to challenge the former Russian woman  The American gave a soulful performance to the gentle melody of River Flows In You but fell from the fliptoolup cascade  The double axel and triple lutz were executed cleanly but she received less points than Gubanova although not by much  6538 points Japanese Higuchi hit with a triplex The weakest was the third group of participants  Only Czech Elishka Brzhezinova and Belarusian Victoria Safonova were pleased with successful performances but they also failed to beat Anastasia Gubanova  Japans Wakabe Higuchi succeeded in displacing the representative of Georgia from the intermediate first place  The vicechampion of the world  2018 gave a touching performance under a cover of Elton Johns song perfectly coping with all the jumping elements  Wakaba performed an excellent triple axel lutztoe loop combination and triple flip but she got quite modest points  7351 points The main hope of the United States in womens single skating Alice Liu did not take risks  Instead of the planned triple axel the American performed a double one  In addition Liu landed a triple flip and a combination of lutztoolups  Alices performance turned out to be bright and emotional but the judges rated it strictly  at 6950 points Belgian Luna Hendrix who has more than once outperformed our skaters in the short program did not do it perfectly this time  The girl hesitantly landed a cascade of lutztoolups and touched the ice on the double axel with her hand  The triple flip was executed flawlessly  The judges traditionally highly appreciated the components of the Belgian thanks to which she received an impressive score of 7009 Many bright and talented skaters performed in the short program but everyone was waiting for the appearance of only one  Kamila Valieva In recent days the whole world has been following the development of a doping scandal with a student of Tutberidze  Camila herself is experiencing the wildest stress all this time Emotions are no longer enough  I am happy but at the same time I am already emotionally tired  So tears Happiness perhaps and a little disappointment  At the same time I am certainly happy to be at the Olympic Games and try to represent our country  And I will hope that I will tune in as much as possible and show my result Valieva told Channel One through tearsIt was scary for the morale of the skater  Not everyone at the age of 15 can withstand such heavy pressure  It is hard to imagine with what thoughts Camila went out on the ice  The fact that a storm was going on in her soul was evident even from the expression on her face Valieva from a young girl seemed to have turned into an adult girl who had seen all the hardships of life  After all that had happened her performance already looked with completely different emotionsIt was no less difficult for Alexandra Trusova and Anna Shcherbakova to perform in all this environment The tension that their coaches and classmate are now experiencing has probably been passed on to them  But the girls are very strong  Sasha does not change himself and continues to take risks  The girl boldly went to the triple axel but traditionally fell from it  The rest of the elements  triple flip and lutztoolup  were performed flawlessly  After the performance Trusova was a little upset and threw up her hands  But she certainly did not regret her risk  Even with a mistake Sasha got good scores  7460  Traditionally you will have to recoup in an arbitrary Shcherbakova unlike Trusova refused to take unnecessary risks  The girl facilitated the program by replacing the lutzrittberger with a lutztoolup  The crown cascade has let the world champion down more than once this season so going for a simplification was the most logical decision  The figure skater perfectly performed a double axel a triple flip and a lutztoe loop cascade while emotionally liberated as much as possible Anya put her whole soul into her rental playing every accent as much as possible  The hall met the girl with a standing ovation and she was clearly pleased with her performance  Shcherbakov was also impressed by the judges who awarded her a life best of 8020 points  The girl came to the Olympics with a serious attitude Closed the girls short program Kaori Sakamoto  The Japanese woman had to leave after the main stars of figure skating but she was not taken aback  She flawlessly performed a double axel a triple lutz and a flip toolup and emotionally went all out  For her performance Kaori received 7984 points  her personal best thanks to which she diluted the Russian trio According to the results of the short program Kamila Valieva took the lead Anna Shcherbakova was second and Kaori Sakamoto was third  Alexandra Trusova remained one step away from the top three  But as usual the free program will decide everything  Our skaters are close to taking the entire podium

Fht5z9YX_pI,<START> what bs is this 
Fht5z9YX_pI,<START> AhwellDue to the US video hegemony of NBC we can neither watch uninterrupted flow of a skaters artistic program ever and are unable to see it without NBC intrusive irrelevant commentary and biasthe Olympic week we had hoped for here reported with still photos will apparently be all we will getThe raising of levels of at least female skaters  remains unavailable Thank you for reporting on the top threethough we can presently only imagine the performances
Fht5z9YX_pI,<START> Kamila may be talented but she is a cheat and maintains no moral values
Fht5z9YX_pI,<START> Send her home
Fht5z9YX_pI,<START> She is a beautiful skater but she shouldnt be skating if she failed a drug test
