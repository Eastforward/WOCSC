G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> Best game in hockey history
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> I remember watching this live with a few friends in one of their basements while pounding back beers We all jumped around cheering after Crosby scored that OT goal Congrats on 500 tonight Sid
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> see in 2022
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> The whole world cheered for Canada
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> 87 the best
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> Whos here in 2022 because of the Olympics right now
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> Crosby the Best
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> We Canadians were just going to be upset if it was a shutout win so we let America catch up on purpose and made the game just that much more upsetting to be an American watching God it felt great to be downtown watching this gold medal game and seeing Americans shamefully shoving their flags into their backpacks
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> Its 2022 now a long time has passed this game may be the best Olympic hockey game ever nothing can change my mind
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> 17 million Canadians watched the game that was half of the population
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> Crosby IGGYUSA Oh shit
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> As an American Penguins fan I was sad we lost but at the same time found solace that it was Sid who scored the winner
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> Lets go Canada
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> God I miss pre Trudeau Canada
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> I think the country peaked at this moment here
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> Great game
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> 011 Stephen Harper is that you
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> At international hockey CanadaUSA games are always epic
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> All of the Canadian Forwards were centers and i believe all the players were Captians and Assistants what a stacked team the played the perfect tournament cant wait till we get to see Crosby and McDavid play together that would be an insane line throw Marner on the Right McDavid on the left
G7DeQbTzPE8,<START> Yall notice Crosby pretty much almost pulled a signature Crosby shot thru four defenders goal at the end
