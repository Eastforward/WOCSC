IiYLoR7UwKs,<START> What real dummy think its a great idea to send any of their diplomats and regular citizens to a country that they are also preparing to go to war withWouldnt it be a great time to invade Taiwan during the Olympics when there are hundreds if not thousands of athletes in that bubble which is basically a prison in itself So if the world dont allow China to invade Taiwan then they can easily hold those people hostage
