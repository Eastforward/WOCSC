K8LcM3aip7Y,<START> Looking back at the previous world wars and local wars because the United States was far away from the battlefield and more importantly because American companies did not transfer a large number of manufacturing to foreign countries at that time the American economy benefited from the wars  But since a large number of American manufacturing companies have relocated overseas especially since China joined the WTO and attracted global manufacturing companies including American companies to relocate their factories to China the US economy no longer benefits from the war Instead every war and disaster indirectly  It has helped Chinas rapid economic development while the US government owes huge debts  From the war in Iraq to the war in Afghanistan to the covid pandemic China has used this opportunity to rapidly develop its economy and increase its national strength  The gap with the US GDP is also getting smaller  If there is a war between Russia and Ukraine this time it is believed that only China and Iran will benefit and even Chinas economic strength will surpass that of the United States
