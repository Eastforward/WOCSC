N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Everyone has a strong opinion about this case yet they dont have the facts and the details about it There must be a valid reason why she was allowed to compete I find it suspicious that the sample was taken in December of the previous year and the results were only reported just before the Team event She is a minor and the officials should be more responsible in handling this case I am also suspicious of those who will directly benefit if this case goes out of hand Some athletes and news agencies in a particular country are exaggerating their reports and trying to insinuate something that puts immense pressure on this young athlete Shameful and irresponsible
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> She shouldnt even be there Those results were from before the olympique She should have been banned to compete
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Drug cheat  wins again what about the clean athletes what you expect from Russia
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Why the hell is she still competing She should  be banned What about ShaCarri Richardson who only took marijuana and got bannedthis is pure injustice
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> She just competing just now she is in first place so far she shouldnt get a  medial If she has a heart condition she should take care of herself
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Russians have been injecting their athletes way before Drago fought Rocky
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> The drug is also administered for angina This aside it is very unprofessional to have a smug smile during professional commentary Plus the guy is right  we are not dumm What happened to the cleaning lady who broke the american team probes by mistake in Rio
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> it is not first time russian involves this kind of scandalsthey take this game very personal they could do everything to  get the gold she is talented sporter yes but she could get a little bit help with these medications also
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Russia shouldnt even be allowed in the Olympics until the ban is lifted that means no ROC
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Its ridiculous how everybody just assumes that Kamila was actually taking that medication And than pour their hate based on the assumption We just dont know enough details for now  it couldve been an accident some traces of that chemical in another product she couldve drinked out of an unwashed glass after her grandparent taking medication and so onWe do know for a fact that she tested negative just 2 weeks after winning the European championship and later at the OlympicsAlso its funny that everybody calls doping a banned but a pretty useless for skaters substanceSo guys lets go easier on the little girl untill it is proven that she actually doped which is not for the moment beingAnd honestly I doubt will be proven because that kind of doping scenario for such athlete whos in another league from the rest of the world  its just surreal Full scale hate campaign and bullying that 15 yo girl by grownups is real though And quite disgusting
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Tbh Russia should be permanently banned for the fact they didnt learn to stop doping
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Doping of WariewaThe medicine used by my grandfather is mixed explained by a lawyerThe apology is unreasonableIts impossible for a 15yearold girl to mistakenly take her grandfathers medicineThe Russian side would have given it to drink as usual to strengthen the playersTo be honest it doesnt matter whether the drug that reacts with doping is mixed in or whether it is intentional or not and athletes who give a positive reaction at the Olympic selection can participate
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> I hope she either bites it or gets booed for the duration of her run or both
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> no Americans Europeans has ever been caught for doping  yet Americans has always won most amount of medals
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> But I bet no one wants to talk about heart issues to an elite athlete who was forced to take a vackseen
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Olympics stopped being Olympics its all political and people all of a sudden found doping after the Ukraine vs Putin disaster
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> I wholeheartedly agree that there shouldnt be unfair advantages given to certain athletes  Thats why it makes me so happy your network will be paying for every single athlete to be able to train in a world class facility with the best equipment coaching staff training staff medical etc  AWESOME of you 
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> russia has still not learnt from its previous state sponsored doping scandals
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Just disgusted by this A bunch of cheaters She should not be allowed to skate and cheat the honest skaters
N8DNb7w9JnY,<START> Full disclosure I believe Kamila is innocent She is young and has a rising career ahead of us no need to take unnecessary risks and ruin her career She is already dominating the field now and can only get better in 4 years However the argument that Kamila is too good she doesnt need it is not valid  this is like saying Lance Armstrong cannot be doping because he is the world champion  the flipside could be true that using performance enhanced drugs helped him maintain his winning Im pointing this out only because such an argument is logically unsound and can alienate those in the middle group away from Kamila
