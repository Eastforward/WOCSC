NLgXnW14BtI,<START> congratulations tarjei boe
NLgXnW14BtI,<START> Its hard to comprehend the challenges Tarjei has been through The torture of being so close so many times so far away with illness and bad shape Then falling TWICE on the asphalt this summer in the same race losing the altitude camp He is SUCH A FIGHTER
NLgXnW14BtI,<START> Perfect podium for me So happy for all three of them Must be so very special to celebrate a podium with your brother At an Olympic competition nonetheless
NLgXnW14BtI,<START> So glad that Tarjei Boe finally got an individual medal  
NLgXnW14BtI,<START> at long last for tarjei this is a dream podium
NLgXnW14BtI,<START> Im going to unsubscribe until after the games Do you not realise people wake up European time and watch recordings of the live races from overnight in Asia
NLgXnW14BtI,"<START> Good work, brothers."
