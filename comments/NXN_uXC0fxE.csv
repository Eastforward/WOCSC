NXN_uXC0fxE,<START> I will write this comment everywhere maybe then people will think and they will not take on faith everything that the propaganda media says without hesitationAnd how do Americans all so honest who are for honest sports feel about the fact that their athletes drink drugs saying that a doctor prescribed it to them But wait legal or not you drink drugs that make you stronger and you win but WADA says its all right its legal Is it fair to other athletes who come out already knowing that you took drugs and they wont beat you No its as unfair as doing it covertly but you keep doing it and its no less depressing for your opponents You are talking about honesty and fairness but are you honest yourself after the whole world learned last year that many athletes from the US and other countries are taking drugs that are banned by WADA After the sanctions of Japan last year Biles showed a poor result without her drugs refused to continue she proved by this that they helped her to take high places Lets take all her medals just like everyone who drinks drugs even if its for health It will be honest and fair if the sick will perform in the Paralympic sport and not with healthy ones And its too cunningly they came up with someone who has a migraine she drinks medicine for migraine but it increases her physical data Is it fair No In such rules there is no honesty and integrity I wont be surprised if all countries have their own laboratories that make new drugs that are not on the WADA list Im sure Why before Sochi Russians were not caught so often on drugs and after Sochi Russians all decide to actively drink them This is strange very strange I wonder which country will be the culprit of such scandals next Which country will stand in the way of the United States to medals  if the world still remains as it is nowI read an interesting comment from Steve here If she is exempt from being accused of doping because she is minor she should not be allowed to compete because she is minor I wrote about patients who drink drugs so I want to paraphrase Steves statement If patients are exempt from doping charges because they are sick they should not be allowed to compete because they are sick Fair enough Honestly It is necessary to take all the medals from S Biles asthmatics from Norwegians and other sick athletes from the USA and other countriesIf you have written the rules then follow them or do not write anything at all openly say that the USA is an exceptional nation and it allows drugs to those who obey them Hypocrites
