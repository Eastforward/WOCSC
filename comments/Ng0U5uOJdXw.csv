Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> What have your thoughts been on the 2022 US Olympic figure skating team
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> I DONT want to know about ice skaters sex lives  I want to see them ice skate
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> Love Nathan Chen gracious poised selfeffacing and a groundbreaking skater  So happy he won the gold    I dont care about the gender identity thing
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> Sexuality shouldnt be a part of sports who cares what you do and who you do it with  Not me  Its really pretty boring
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> This nonbinary thing is getting a bit boring They come across as history detached drama queens who crave attention 1976 British figure skater openly came out before winning the World and Olympic Gold Even before this many public figures sports people actors and musician had made it known they were gay In 2022 in the Western hemisphere this isnt a big deal and even legal issues arent so much discrimination as much as anomalies in the mass of laws we live under They seem to enjoy drawing attention to themselves so they can complain about the attention I and millions of others dont live our lives in the belief that all we have to offer is our sexuality
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> HAHAHAHA A male figure skater really need to open up about his sexuality Isnt it obvious
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> Nonbinary Wtf is that
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> Yes What does it matter Thank you NBC for coming out Now how about same sex
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> I dont care about others sexual preferences
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> Hell World
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> What hypocrisy  this nonbinary rubbish What about being judged on your talent instead of your identity you say it in one statement only to turn around and push your nonbinary nonsense  Quite obvious you are sick in the head  Yes  we KNOW previous skaters were something other than straight but they UNDERSTOOD we wanted to see their TALENT not their SICKNESS on the ice
Ng0U5uOJdXw,<START> 1st
