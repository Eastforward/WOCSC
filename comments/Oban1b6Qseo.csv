Oban1b6Qseo,<START> KOREANS CAN NOT CHEAT ANY MORE WITH THIS CAMERAS
Oban1b6Qseo,<START> But this is of no use The Korean media never dared to tell Koreans the factual videos of fouls They just kept telling them with some screenshots that the entire referee team was taking bribes They dared not show Koreans full videos or gifs in a utopia full of deceit Based on lies and creating antiChina sentiment this is exactly what the Korean opposition party wants to see most before the presidential election
