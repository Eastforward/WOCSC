PTmoaDG_k8M,<START> I live in Alberta Canada and our handling of the Covid19 pandemic may look good in comparison to the US which is a worst case scenario but pathetic when compared to China My wife and I have both received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine but  I have my doubts with respect to the efficacy of the vaccine I have no regrets with respect to the vaccinations I have received as I have suffered no side effects and hopefully it will provide some measure of protection I keep hearing that the Covid19 situation has improved but the number of people in hospital and ICU has not improved since last summer Some restrictions could be relaxed but mandatory mask wearing and social distancing should remain in place especially in the schools
