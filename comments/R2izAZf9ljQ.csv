R2izAZf9ljQ,<START> Besides Japan and Korea I seriously believe that China is gonna be the next Asian figure skating powerhouse They have come so far and so fast in such a few short years Cant wait to see more of them on the International podiums  in the near future
R2izAZf9ljQ,"<START> It is also a kind of new aristocrats in China. The sports fee of 500 per hour stops 999 children, and then the institutionalized teaching is not enough to pay for new things. The coaches are mostly from northeast China"
R2izAZf9ljQ,<START> Wonderful dream 
R2izAZf9ljQ,<START> Different from the emphasis on the Summer Olympics China had only three northeastern provinces engaged in ice and snow sports before and all the ice and snow talents came from the three northeastern provinces It is precisely the success factor of Chinas bid to host the Winter Olympics that has driven the development of ice and snow sports in China The number of people participating in ice and snow sports has reached more than 300 million By the end of 2020 China had 654 standard ice rinks and 803 indoor and outdoor ski resortsThis may be the meaning and purpose of Chinas bid to host the Winter Olympics
R2izAZf9ljQ,<START> I believe that snow sport is still in its infancy in China But wait another few years and China will be really competitive  
R2izAZf9ljQ,<START> I started ice skating when I was six I did not get into figure skating or ice hockey but this year I started playing shinny hockey I do have friends who figure skate though I wouldnt mind watching figure skating as it is like dancing on ice
