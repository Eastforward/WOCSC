SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Gold medal and Olympic ceremony for K baby
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Kamila Valieva is champion its all a policy to discredit Russia at the cost of a childs life
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> I think we the rest of the world are so tired of American propaganda that we might all start throwing up soon Kamila is doing the triple axel with hands above her head which of Im not mistaken is called a Rippon Adam be ashamed of your words and be honored that this incredibly talented girl uses that move that is named after you
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Whats shameful is the american media sucking up to the racist   homophobic  murderous  Islamophobic host of a country You are morally bankrupt scum who support what China does SHAME 
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Its unfair for other skaters
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Quit crying whiner
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> I adore him
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Didnt Midori do the Rippon first
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> I kind of lost sympathy for her when she said it was a mixup between her and her grandpas medication like come on girl Id be pissed if I was that grandpa
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Whatever you think about the situation its sort of gross that hes smiling and grinning throughout the whole thing Its an awful situation all around I get it that hes gleeful that America has a shot at a default team medal but his presentation is very unprofessional I didnt think Tara and Johnny were nice on their instagrams but thats their own platform On camera when commentating they were appropriate and not weirdlycreepygiddygleeful about the issue People knew where they stood personally but they were professional This guy just seemed so happy about someone elses pain
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Whatevers Adam had done to his face is kinda uncanny valley vibes
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> It was a cross contamination with a trace of a drug her grandfather took  Not enough to affect her but to show up in a trace amount in a test  The is HUGELY different than someone who took a drug to have an advantage over others  Adam Rippon can put his claws away and meow somewhere else  He is ridiculous  She was disqualified for the events she skated because the test was positive  The committee agreed all the evidence pointed to a miniscule cross contamination  which DOES happen  She will skate and do so with more athleticism talent and honor than this twit Rippon could EVER hope to have  His words will come to haunt him imo  Valieva will be the worlds greatest skater and Rippon a nobody
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Adam needs his own show his students are lucky to have him as a coach but having him as commentator could have been so much fun
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> She Kari Richardson did not have the funds to pay off the IOC
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> when i first saw kamila skate last week i was in tears because of how amazing her talent was to me i was inspired when the news broke after that i was thinking how could pills make someone skate like that its about more than that though after watching her tonight i realized it didnt feel right seeing her win first place even though her talent was undeniable with or without cheating i didnt want to accept this but its not fair
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> i COMPLETELY agree
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> Ti si tu≈æan i zlobani jadan
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> As a russian my first reaction was offensive to Adam Rippon but now I must admit that he is right Shame on doctors and trainers of Kamila for such irresponsible reaction Gold medal for Russia is not worth all that hate Those who really guilty for that doping must have courage to admit their fault and cancel Kamilas performance She will still have enough starts in her future to prove everyone shes the best
SHjfdmJJFF0,<START> You are crazy
