Tlb7Ep2zuEo,"<START> Today, as Chinese people, as Beijing people, we are not so concerned about the Olympic Games, because our rich and happy life does not need to be recognized by the Olympic Games and westerners. As for the attitude towards the United States, we do not want him to point at the United States to bring the epidemic, bring disaster, bring bad luck and be grateful for the arrival of the United States government"
Tlb7Ep2zuEo,<START> Western media but at what cost
Tlb7Ep2zuEo,<START> Guess againBoycott the Hitleresque Olympic propaganda games I know of no one watching the terror gamesChina is an economic miracle due to cheap laborNo one goes there for freedomNo one goes there for the arts literature educationTerror in Hong KongTerror against Taiwan Boycott communismBoycott genocide
Tlb7Ep2zuEo,<START> what can i say love it
Tlb7Ep2zuEo,<START> In short will there be Medals handed out if the answer is Yes then Yes it will be a success At least for the Athletes What is really hypocritical though is the boycott from the Media We all know it is a political event But its original Olympian spirit puts friendly competition before all else While a boycott is pretty much the opposite Olympic games in Germany 1936 The Americans were there
