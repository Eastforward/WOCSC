WsEUSrpodTA,<START> What are your thoughts on Zhu Yi
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> This is false regarding Eileen Gu Theres no record of her relinquishing her US citizenship and she refuses to answer such questions Highly doubtful she gave up her US citizenship There would be a record of this
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> I bet shes regretting giving up her citizenship  Eileen Gu should be banned from entering the US  let her stay in China
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Long arm of capitalism tripped her up  this is karma and its what she gets Have fun working in a sweat shop because you failed your communist regime traitor If she ever comes back to the states she should face the same consequences as people who defect during wartime Softness to traitors will destroy us all
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> So when the Russian team lose their team medal and China inherit the bronze are they are going to refuse it as they dont agree with the team selection I doubt it
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Ive been subscribed you for years Never knew that You are so disgusting
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Chinese dont like her because we are not sure if she got selected because of her competency or because she got a rich dad If someone got selected because of this there will a poor girl who prepared for years but didnt got selected You cant  read the comments in Chinese You just think we only adore the ppl who can win It was not the case We appreciate all the athletes We just dont like favoritism
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Communist You got what you deserve
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Vincent explained how he isolated himself for months  that was his mistake and thats why he caught the virus now He should have tried to catch it earlier to develop natural anti bodies and so he wouldnt have it during the Olympics
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> China set policy to protect majority rights and saved more lives over individuals rights  You can call it as individuals human rights is violated but the majority people trusted their government
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Zhu can do it
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> I do not agree with her choice of giving up her citizenship to compete for China but that is her choice not mine that being said I think she just needs to get all of the naysayers out of her brain focus concentrate and just do your best if she does that hopefully she will give a good performance maybe even come away with the metal get some of those naysayers out of your brain and quiet them down I wish all the athletes the best of luck God bless bye
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> I am a Chinese person and I was stunned after watching this video In the age of information technology I can still blow it like thisThe whole network in China cares about helps and understands her and there are only a few people with rhythmIn addition regarding the nationality of her and Gu although I dont know the real situation it is for ordinary people that China does not allow dual nationality If you are very powerful you can go to any country at will This is called freedom of nationalityMoreover they are both from elite families and the elites look farther Why did their parents go to the United States in the first place Why go back to China now There is an old Chinese saying People go to high places
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Giving up US Citizenship for Chinese is the equivalent of moving from the penthouse to the Sewer
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> You dont have to explain I call this instant karma Traitor
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Poor girl So stressful Hope she does really well  She deserves all the good luck Its not easy to integrate that can cause challenges in performance Competition can be very overwhelming 
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> I see everyone isnt in agreement in the comments Keep it up 
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Communists belong on a cross
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Couldnt have been more sweet
WsEUSrpodTA,<START> Oh yeah When you have a gold everyone loves you like the ChineseAmerican or I should say AmericanChinese skier But if you dont do well like Zhu Yi then theyre embarrassed and ashamed of her Thats so typical Chinese
