WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Katelyn won the gold in 2018 She Yuna and all the other chested girls deserve better than ISU and IOC corruption Med and Zag were on the regimen too
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Hey USA how about focusing on closing your borders then worrying about Ukraine
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Those who defend Valieva as a victim because she is young are also liarsValieva is a tainted adult who dares to lie blatantly when the evidence is clearValieva is the beneficiary not the victim For doping Valieva won medals that should have been given to other athletes and gained fame and fortuneThe real victims are honest athletes who practiced quad jumps without resorting to vile means to compete with drug users like Valieva and then gave up on Olympic Games or even sacrificed their careers due to injuriesIt would be a blatant lie to claim that the drug was detected in Valievas doping test because of her grandfatherWhat came out of Valievas doping test wasnt just the heart drugs used for dopingA diuretic used to excrete various drugs to destroy evidence of doping has also emergedIn other words the detection of heart drugs is only the tip of the icebergRussia has developed special techniques to keep their athletes free from doping tests and Valieva only got caught by mistake
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> I feel like this issue will be just ignored like what happened to sochi
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Kamila was tested clean before games Whats a problem now Why she called her unclean
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Kamila We are with you angel 
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> She has three teammates with the same coach so it is impossible for her to deliberately use doping she opens a new era she should not be smeared
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> What a talanted 15yo figure skater Enjoying her performances Her case is very complicated 1 The sample was from december and it took 45 days to announce the results while the normal period is 20 days It showed just A TRACE of microdose of the drug A TRACE 2 All other samples are clean 3 She seem not need any drug and medicine She is young and strong also it is not an athletic People love her for the artiscism  Also the commete should do their job not pressuring her without media without announces because it is dificult to imagine what damage to her psyche can apply But despite all of the pressure she showed the highest scores
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Athlete who violates doping cannot compete in the game This principle must be observed without exception All players efforts and dreams are equally precious
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> If the skaters are not clean they should not be allowed to skate  The Olympics should  be on an even scale  Not skating clean breaks the trust I  the system  Everyone should have the rules appied equally
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Off topic but is this woman related to the Osmond family ie Donny and Marie
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> keep excusing the cheats and youll keep getting these scandals every other Olympiad
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Especially if you consider that Karolyn s  main opposition were also from the same training rink as Valieva and whose is to know that there were not performance enhancing drugs in the vitamins that competitors from that rink have admitted to been given
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> I really appreciate a more unbiased opinion on this situation I imagine it would be difficult to remain calm when youve been through the same competitions The fact is as the public we dont have a good deal of information While Kamila is most certainly old enough to understand the wrongness of doping I do think the number one concern is her health I think we forget that athletes are people Even if the situation ends up putting her clearly as guilty down the road I would be concerned about her mental health first and foremost
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Wow really impressed by Kaetlyn  She seems to be very genuine and heartfelt in her answers  Witty too
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Shes being way too nice
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> I dont want to see a quad in womens figure skating I miss the days of Yuna Osmond Mao and Karolina
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Whether intentional or not with the drug the Drug is in her blood regardless that helped her Win Unfairly  No Drug she probably would have gotten Silver Bronze Fairlyor no metal
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> If she respected the sport she would have withdrawn from the compitition its as simpla as that
WtAIzEN2Z08,<START> Not only Kamila but the entire Russian team shouldnt be allowed to skate They are supposed to be banned arent they Banning a piece of cloth in your countys flag accompishes nothing As for Kamila being 15 yrs old that is not an excuse to give her a pass shes old enough to know what the deal is and the testing Tara Lipinski was 15 when she won gold and she knew she said she wouldnt even eat a poppyseed bagel I also believe the scoring is being skewed here as well now That even needs to be scrutinized as well There were skaters that skated beautiful clean programs after her  that shouldve scored higherthan Kamils bc her skate was far from perfect
