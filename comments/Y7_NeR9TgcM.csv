Y7_NeR9TgcM,<START> They are talking about the results of the test of the Russian figure skater which was made at least a MONTH AGO in December 2020 A month has 30 days or 720 hours 43200 minutes Why did they learn about the results of this test in such a way that this story appeared in the media at the most favorable moment for antiRussian propaganda Not a minute earlier not a minute later The procedure for awarding figure skaters is at its peak Everyone is on the podium literally in a few seconds medals will appear The TV program has the highest viewer ratings  and just at this exact moment  just coincidentally do you believe in such coincidences  the world suddenly found out about the results of a test that was made more than a month ago Out of more than 43200 minutes why exactly at this particular minute did they start spinning this story Everyone remembers the story that the Western media spread to the whole world about the alleged use of doping by Russian athletes at the Sochi Winter Olympic Games in 2014 However it is likely that 95 of people in the world do not know and will never know about the following fact On February 1 2018 in Lausanne Switzerland the Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS announced its decision on cases in which 39 Russian athletes appealed their suspension related to the Sochi Winter Olympic Games in 2014 The courts decision is as follows     for 28 athletes  there are no evidences ALL penalties have been cancelled     for 11 athletes  the appeals were partially satisfied the violations were confirmed     for 3 athletes hearings have been postponed That is in 72 of cases 28 out of 39 considered by the court THE DOPING CHARGES WERE FABRICATED  and no one was punished for thisHow long will a person work as a doctor who misdiagnoses 72 of the time  You know the answerHow long will a person work as a truck driver who 72 of the time passes an intersection on a red traffic light You know the answerHow long will work a person engaged in the spread of antiRussian hysteria and who brazenly lies in 72 of cases  Endlessly

Y7_NeR9TgcM,<START> Its clearly a case of politics and sabotage  This girl has been dazzling and winning since she was 5 years old  Long before she joined the Russian national team Watch her old videos This girl is a real phenom with godgifted talents  So she was doping all the while to win This is not weightlifting swimming or a marathon competition 50 of the scores are on artistry Most skaters dont even bother working on artistry because its easier to score on the technical portion Nathan Chen won gold by being a good jumping bean by throwing in 4 quads despite not much artistry She won by 30 points despite a fall and scores in the short program beat the boys And when she broke world records she broke it by a huge margin all the while testing negative The alleged failing of the drug test was for months ago before she competed and won at the European championships We dont even know if this allegation is true The media makes up stories all the time She tested negative in Beijing Dont rule out sabotage to break this talented girl either from the outside or inside
