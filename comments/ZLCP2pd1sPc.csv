ZLCP2pd1sPc,<START> It would have been reasonable to sweep the podium on the first day of the award ceremony for short track speed skating but today it is race of speed skating There is no contact between the athletes and the competition is absolutely fair The Korean athlete really doesnt deserve the gold medal for being narrowminded Also this was done by Canadian short track speed skating team at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics2018in South Korea This Korean athlete stole this move which means he also thinks the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics are unfair He brought shame on the Korean people
ZLCP2pd1sPc,<START> Warm congrats
