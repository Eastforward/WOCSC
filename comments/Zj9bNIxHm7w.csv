Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> You know the rules before you go to Beijing  Why you chose to come  Stay in your free country and make up stories in your toilet
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> these jouranlist are unhappy because they cant leave the close loop system to get footage of UNHAPPY chinese citizens so they can create fake news back home
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> Unreasonable request Almost every country has journalists in China What do they usually do make up lies in the office and then stay in the bar at night
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> China is a candy store hope they get over covid soon so I can visit stay well get better 
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> it is easy to be a normal tourist accept 14 days quarantinecoz all olympic relate personnel dont follow this process they r not allow to wander
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> Yes according to those people with political color filters they are real frustration in front of such a confident optimistic and prosperous China Big contrast to their western declined and broken society
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> This is called a close loop you should know it before coming to the Olympics Look at how many people contracted the Coid every day in US and Western countries If the Covid rule is loose and China ends up with the same mess as the western country will there be a Winter Olympics Please be grateful and respect the rules
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> It will take another 50 years  to have HSR in US or Canada or may be longer   Such a great shame   lol
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> If you think the restricted anticovid policy is wrong you should blame your government which messed it up If your country can do the same work as China is doing the covid19 would have gone one year ago Your stupidity has put all human beings into risk Wearing mask and take vaccines are basic requirements and its too hard for people in your country to follow Maybe the requirement is too high for you kind of human race
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> What are you doing there in the first place if you dont want to follow the rules    
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> I think closed loop is great Reporters generally have full hatred and predetermined biases towards china anyway Staying within the loop makes you guys more comfortable I actually think you guy should not go there seriously just stay within your great democracy and enjoy your freedom
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> Meanwhile in Canada it takes more time travel from Hamilton to Toronto but less than 100km
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> Just because you want to come out of the bubble doesnt mean we should let you come out We dont owe you anything You sound like a spoiled kid who doesnt get what he wants and just cry
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> Olympics is meant to be an international festival and an opportunity of tourism  However this is a special time of pandemic  China takes serious measures of social control  Other countries may see Chinas approach as too serious
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> come on  If you want to split hairs go back to Canada and get infected with COVID  Do you poor Canadians even have high speed rails  Oops I guess NOT
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> Another joker frm Can Ada
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> Poor journalists Cry me a river 
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> stop the dramas its rules agreed between IOC and chinese govt that all atheletes journalists chinese volunteers stay inside the loop for the entire period of the olympic if u want to exit the loop u have to be in quarantine 147 days then u can visit anywhere in china every inbound travellers to china have been subjected to the same rules since summer 2020 even all famous hong kong female singer GEM  she has at least 100 million fans in mainland china followed the same quarantine rulesand china doesnt just put winter olympic events inside the close loops all chinese intl airports that takes intl inbound travellers have been putting inside their own close loops since summer 2020 chinese pilots flight attendants airport workers custom officers immigrantion officers all live in dorms or airport hotels inside their close loops they stay inside the loop at least 3 months per shift and cant go home before exiting the loop they also have to follow 147 days quarantine rules so many chinese volunteers sacrifice their own freedom and endure so much inconvenience to ensure a safe and successful olympic during the pandemic i think thats something u should report
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> Journalist I want to talk with ordinary peopleNo we dont unless you took 147 quarantine
Zj9bNIxHm7w,<START> So he wanted to go to the Olympic villages reporting and talk to athletes or just stayed in the city It looks like everyone is on the way to go to the village except him
