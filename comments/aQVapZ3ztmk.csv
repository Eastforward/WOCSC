aQVapZ3ztmk,<START> Good that China aint first
aQVapZ3ztmk,<START> Well must be 15 year old so she prob wont be competing
aQVapZ3ztmk,<START> What exactly are these legal issues that is what we want to know but instead we are hearing nothing I find that objectionable and I do not wish to lose my bottom dolar on your nonsense report
aQVapZ3ztmk,<START> Banned substance Yes They lose end of story Silken Laumenn took a banned substance in a cold remedy by accident disqualification Should be same here Why the legal battle It should be a done deal
