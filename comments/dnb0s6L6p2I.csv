dnb0s6L6p2I,<START> The talent of the Russian rocket is admired far beyond the borders of our country  Sasha has attracted the attention of world famous people more than once Alexandra Trusova is a phenomenal girl whose fame goes far beyond figure skating  Even popular musicians and Hollywood stars bow before her quadruple jumps and talent  The figure skater who defeated gravity and launched the womens single into space attracts the attention of the most sophisticated public Yes and how else  After all she is a personality with a capital letter  A person who follows his own special path in bigtime sports and finds a lively response and support from others In her first adult season Alexandra Trusova performed in a free program in the image of the main character of the Game of Thrones series Daenerys Targaryen  Sasha reincarnated on ice as the mistress of dragons  The Russian rocket which the fans already then tacitly dubbed the queen of quads this role fit perfectly  But Trusova still tried to understand as much as possible how and what to skate about so she not only watched several seasons of the series but also read John Martins book A Song of Ice and Fire which formed the basis of the screen story Sashas efforts were not in vain she turned out to be an ideal mistress  Only not dragons but quadruple jumps with which she skated to the Game of Thrones soundtrack  Pray High Valyrian  This song was written by the leader of the famous British rock band Muse Matt Bellamy  Tense music with heroic notes successfully accompanied the dizzying jumps of the figure skater and helped from the first seconds to set the audience to watch an exciting rental Under this track Trusova won her first adult Grand Prix stage  Skate Canada and immediately set two world records in the free program and in the sum of both programs  Then Sasha landed three of the four quads two of which were in a cascade  It was an incredible achievement and it did not go unnoticed by Matt Bellamy himself The musician saw a video of Sashas performance to his song and admired the brave Russian figure skater conquering quadruple jumps  In honor of her victory he published a separate post on his Instagram Congratulations to Alexandra Trusova on winning the Skate Canada with three quads  And thanks to her for using Pray High Valyrian as the soundtrack wrote Bellamy But quite a lot of figure skaters skated to the songs of the Muse group but it was Sasha who received such attention and personal congratulations from a rock star Alexandra of course was flattered by the attention of Matt Bellamy but being a fan of the Game of Thrones she really wanted the actress who played Daenerys Emilia Clarke to also appreciate her free program  To fulfill this desire she recorded a video message for her idol which was then posted on the official Instagram page of the Olympic channel Hi Emilia Clarke  We have a message for you from Alexandra Trusova the caption says I want the actress who plays Daenerys to write to me somewhere  Or I would like to meet her Trusova said Sashas meeting with Emilia Clarke did not take place  Whether the actress wrote to her is unknown  But at least Emilia noticed her although she is not interested in figure skating  In any case messages surfaced on American forums that Emilia saw Sashas rental and liked it and she also conveyed greetings to the athlete on her own behalf Another Hollywood star who was impressed by the skating of Alexandra Trusova is the legendary actress Sharon Stone  In February last year she reposted in her stories a video with a fragment of Sashas demonstration number to the song Game of Survival performed by Ruelle  She spotted this video on the instagram page thefigureskatingworld  On it the skater performs her signature element  the cantilever  Sharon was so impressed by this trick on the ice that she could not resist and shared it with her And it can be understood anyone who has ever seen Sasha making a cantilever will agree that she is an unsurpassed master in it  Among girls sure And among the guys few will be able to challenge her in this matter  And if he does he will most likely lose  The Russian rocket is second to none  Especially the strong sex In the Olympic season Alexandra Trusova again skates in a free program to the soundtrack from a famous film  This time the choice fell on Cruella  On the ice the figure skater appears as the insidious main character played in the film itself by the inimitable Emma Stone  According to Sasha she would like to meet this actress and perhaps ask her how best to convey the image of Cruella However Trusova does an excellent job without any advice  But it will be great if Emma Stone watches the performance of our queen of quads and leaves her star review
dnb0s6L6p2I,<START> I watched Sashas short program last night There was a split second in the middle of the routing where the camera did a closeup shot of her face and she smiled directly at it while still staying in character as she was skatingI could see how happy she was to be at the Olympics and most of all how much she was loving it out on the ice Whether she medals or not Sasha will still be known as a legend and pioneer in jumping for womens skating
dnb0s6L6p2I,<START> Sharon Stone Emma Stone as if the mountains cradled her genius nurturing the spark within the crucible until even the furnace fell short unable to contain the flame
dnb0s6L6p2I,<START> I feel so bad for Trusova She along with the other two members Anna Scherbakova and Alena Kostornaya truly revolutionized ladies figure skating but their contributions have been ignored in favor of Valieva I amNot fully convinced that Valieva had not been offered enhancement drugs prior to the Olympics  And even her record breaking performances should be looked upon as suspect
dnb0s6L6p2I,<START> Keep striving for that axel.
