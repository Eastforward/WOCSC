e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> Now Kamila mentioned about her grandfather mediciation  How could her grandfather medication contaminated her
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> Hanyu was the moment
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> I have no desire to watch doped athletes compete against clean athletes  whats the point
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> If it was an American the athlete would be done The coaches would be done The parents would be done  Heck Look at the HUGE debate over the positive test for weed not much of a performance enhancing drug and if anything it is a depressant and would not be advantageous to consume before being asked to run any race let alone a 100 meter dash before Tokyo for ShaCarri Richardson But the US said nope we said its not allowed so youre not going Could you imagine Russia saying the same Ha Thats a joke
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> When it comes to if Kamila was ok with doping to be a star like Zhenya I doubt she even knew she was taking them Eteri always refers to the pill cocktails she gives the girls as vitamins even saying as one thing gets banned theyll find something else to give them because the girls need their vitamins she may have just believed thats what they were not banned substances that could be bad for herJohnny and Tara I dont blame them for what they say Theres very clearly things they are told to say and things told not to say Including praise for nearly any skater other than Nathan till the free and then only for ones that wouldnt be a threat to medal because NBC has this whole narrative built around him to pull in viewers Like if you compare their commentary to 2018 they used to be funnier but also had a lot more to say about each skate including a lot more nice comments about the skaters themselves and their performance Both times Johnny spoke about Jason and how good he is it felt like he was going off script those were things he wasnt supposed to say It felt like not just giving him the praise he deserves but a moment of solidarity because he went through the same thing the ISU and USFSA are doing to him But the way they really had Tara talk about the struggles Nathan faced in the last 4 years after his privileged ass said what he did about LGBTQA dominating the sport really With this homophobic ISU keeping everyone in the closet Really and he was the poor straight boy trying to make it masculine when he has been getting all these inflated scores they really gave his very obvious baxel from the short a 4 goe how is that a real score and his failure at 2018 was just him not skating well  and not the federation or the ISU being against him And saying he struggled like that while sitting right next to Johnny who actually did have to fight through all kinds of bullshit basically his whole career Its clear they have teleprompters and cue cards telling them what to say And theyre not going to let them speak against Eteri because the ISU doesnt want that Why I think Johnny is saying minimal about the situation on twitter even because if he speaks against her hes done for regardless of how much he actually knows about how those girls are treatedThose death threats from fanyus were proven to not be true There were very few english comments on his posts at all and most unhappy comments were to do with him not doing well at the team event People fully made that up on twitter where it spread to reddit and then back to twitter and people took it as true I love listening to you guys and like most of the video but thats not cool And Im not a Yuzuru shooter being defensive or anything Im a Jason girl and I saw all that unfold on twitter and no one having an actual source for it and actually bothering to checking his instagram Yeah he has a lot of fans and fanyus can be nuts but its not cool to blame an entire fanbase on something maybe one or two did I was seeing everything go down as the event happened no one was really blaming him or anyone even though the hole was big enough he put half his hand in it I saw what were very clearly jokes about checking Nathans locker for a hammer but again jokes He has the fans he does for a reason you know theyre not just nuts for him because hes pretty or engages with them on social media or anything He has these fans because hes really good And not just at jumps but actual skating edges transitions all of it So why are people that are his fans people that know nothing Meanwhile people coming on tweets about Yuzurus 4A posting videos of that short program baxel going yeah well can he do this Nathan won suck it but when people point out its a god awful Axel they say people are being mean because they dont know anything about it and thought it looked cool and they like him just because hes American People who literally know nothing Didnt help his team Yeah because the JSF has it out for him for forever He had the nerve to beat Disuke at 2014 the presidents fave and shes never forgave him for that and they DIDNT EVEN ASK HIM TO DO THE TEAM EVENT Its not that he refused they didnt want him they wanted Shoma and Yuma Something that hurt him fyi he mentioned in an interview he would have loved to do the Team event again Again whats with spreading misinformation Its like you guys hate him or something Also Yuzu did land it in practice he showed Nobu I think it was him Or one of the reporters a video of it And the 4A was certified if not ratified it was scored as a A4 not downgraded to a 3A He had fucked his ankle during that practice session before and couldnt feel his right foot during the freeSurprised that you didnt mention Donovan first time a Mexican skater has made it to the free skate in the Olympics coming from a mall rink he did so good in my opinion such a good skate for him Hopefully this is going to be a push for him to get better training facilities he can really go places and I cant wait to see where hell be in a few yearsMy best moment was when I had the podium from my deepest and unlikely fantasies Yuzu Jason and Junhwan I got just a taste of that being reality and I appreciated that
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> You guys are hilarious and on point lol
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> If you watch the congratulatory video from USFS for Nathans win I think Evan Lysaceks advice really hit it spot on and you guys touched on it too on how rare it is for an OG medalist to really enjoy such a moment when they are under so much pressure My heart is so full for Nathan I hope he keeps skating
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> i too love roman sadowsky  i have felt that what he needs is a change of venue  he needs i think to skate in a rink where he is not the best skater i dont know what other quads he has besides the toe and sal but its his nerves that seen to do him in he needs to build confidence in himself and i dont think he will get that where he is training  i am surprised the canadian federation hasnt suggested something altho maybe they have it is so sad what happened to him i hope skate canada doesnt write him off
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> With Hanyus stamina I dont think he would be able to handle team event so it was best he didnt do it Also I dont think outcome would be different
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> Thanks for this fantastic video I was so excited to see that Zagorodniuk was a guest I remember watching him as a child and loving his skating and always feeling that he was undermarked and underappreciated By the way Jonathan is actually correct the pronunciation is MelDOnium and not meldoNIum
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> In other sports entire teams get disqualified if one member tests positive Thats why Usain Bolt lost his Olympic gold from the Beijing 4x100m when Nesta Carter failed a test If that pattern was followed every event would need to be rescored without the ROC
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> Jonathan Nathan cited Massimo Scali working with him since November and addressing the musical details and other nuances  Also showing what he was feeling during the skates  See Phil Hershs excellent article dated either 211 or 21222  Also very lovely Raf supported Scalis work and presence
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> I dont believe Hanyu blamed the hole on the ice for the 4S failure  He only talked about it but was accepting that it was likely from a toe jump so couldnt blame anyone but only his bad luck
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> Yumas dad had a beautiful 3A and that wonderful knee bend A high jumper 
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> Since Scali collaborated wNathan Nathans request and won I wonder if Alysas dad is wondering about his decision to have Alysa abruptly leave Scali 
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> Second comment on this video  I really enjoyed all skaters I was hoping none would have a mistake all were wonderfull  with their own performances challenges etc I really enjoy it of course was really sad seeing Yuzuru fighting this hard for his program been alone I really do not agree with Brian excuse of Yuzu wanted to be alone I desagree on this it looket like I am with you when you win not when you looseI totally happiness with Shoma Uno and Yuma skating really happy to see bouth there on the podium specially Shoma who has ween my skating heart since 2016And now would hope to see must of this skaters at worlds please let it happend
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> Nathan was the Olympic moment we all needed Seeing him just be there and enjoy it and the confidencehe is so so trained and so talented and he knew he could and would do it Yuzuru didnt give him the run for his money that was possible but also just realized he would have had it in the bag regardless So proud of him
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> I did see Jason Browns short program and free skate on the NBC Sports Channel but for some reason they were taken down 
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> How exciting to see Viacheslav Wasnt expecting that treat
e5nfCSp3HSQ,<START> Thanks for all your great videos I have been spending lots of time watching them all so I call you guys my best buds when I talk to my husband about TSL and ATBT
