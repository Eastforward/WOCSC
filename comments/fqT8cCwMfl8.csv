fqT8cCwMfl8,<START> I dont like her personality Talk too much Full of herself
fqT8cCwMfl8,<START> After winning gold for china Eileen Gu will take all the medals and money earned from chinese endorsements back to US I bet the thought of being a chinese citizen probably never crosses her mind even for 1 second And shes probably going to marry some famous white American rather than give a thought of marrying a china man
