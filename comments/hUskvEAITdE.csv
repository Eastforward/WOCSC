hUskvEAITdE,<START> I hope the next Olympics can go completely healthy and now I can have his training
hUskvEAITdE,<START> i dont know how hard it was for him he was the one who break the records and this performance maybe out from his mind too but he could finish his show and thats the matterest thing
hUskvEAITdE,<START> one thing i realized after watching this when failure got you in front of people or when you down and every single eyes on you you have to remember that show must go on and life either no pressed button to stop the time or no rocks to hide you away facing everything in front of you dont run and try to keep you head and heart calm Whatever it was life must go on
hUskvEAITdE,<START> Incredible performance 
hUskvEAITdE,<START> Wow hes only 19 here I cant believe hes 27 now he hasnt aged at all So adorable

hUskvEAITdE,"<START> At this time, even if you fall twice, it's money, or is it a different level than now?"
hUskvEAITdE,"<START> I love the visuals and performances of those days, I want to go back, I want to taste that excitement again, I guess skating's heyday is in your teens and early 20s."
hUskvEAITdE,<START> The sport changed soo much If he have been able to do what he did today it probably had broken a world record
hUskvEAITdE,<START> new discovery of how wonderful skating is
hUskvEAITdE,<START> Nice.
