iOrjnQavC7c,<START> After winning gold for china Eileen Gu will take all the medals and money earned from chinese endorsements back to US I bet the thought of being a chinese citizen probably never crosses her mind even for 1 second And shes probably going to marry some famous white American rather than give a thought of marrying a china man
iOrjnQavC7c,<START> She has been representing China since 2016  But the Americans call her traitor by now only because she got olympic golds  So the problem is not on her choice it is the jealousness of the golds
