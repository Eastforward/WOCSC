iQhQMEUwfa0,<START> The Olympic organizing committee can take the lions share of the credit for this mess If necessary they could have postponed the games for one year And that young woman is an emotional mess which undoubtedly will or would have had a significant negative impact on her health if she had chosen or chooses to move forward and try to compete

iQhQMEUwfa0,<START> My friend who has a biathlon friend there is afraid that he might not be able to come home because he has a Winnie the Pooh sticker on his gun which is meant for something else along with they took every single biathlons firing pin and mess with the trigger finger the one thing you dont mess with is it biathlon because they can kill people within 5 minutes in an entire room full of people because theyre they are the Hicks of every nationyep they have been asking questions about there home country yet they refuse to talk about because of whats happening in China or all around China because the athletes refuse to talk about politicsnot only that but the reason why they are given very little to eat its because of the famine theyre not preparing food theyre preparing for war
iQhQMEUwfa0,<START> Athletes need to also blame themselves for joining the Olympics in China This was expected and people going to foreign countries can never expect to be treated well
