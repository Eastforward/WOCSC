iSZ32irrgtc,<START> So its okay to dope 15 years old very  stupid excuse she should not skate at all
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> Look around and also look at Simone Biles who actually looks like some kind of Simon and who is allowed to use strong drugs for medical reasons On this Hellplanet injustice is everywhere Why some people have decided that it is necessary to start with this 15yearsold girl without even waiting for the end of the investigation and the final verdict of CAS
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> Russian Bear for the WIN
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> All the Russians didnt die even when unified Europes armies which ones usedmethamphetamine got to the Volga river in November 1942  actually Russia without using any drugs became a great power exactly at that momentWith this little scandal because of the negligible amount of trimetazidine in the urine of a Tatar teenage girl  Camilla Russia will not even bother
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> She isnt qualified to attend the competition Unfairness matters
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> Disgusting a liar and a cheat
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> Doping queen 
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> they should have delivered the result in 20 days after that its invalid It was delivered in 45 days coincidentally in the hot time of Russian conflict with Ukraine which is hugely discussed in media in the day Russia  the wrong country  its figure skating team won gold in team event and Kamila was praised by media for her performance and quads There should be no place for politics in sport And Kamila didnt need that drug she was the winner before
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> May you live like the lotus  at ease in the muddy water 
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> This is ridiculous  she should NOT be allowed to compete a banned substance was found in her test results Shes busted for doping  she should be disqualified
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> Russia is always in trouble and cowardlyThey also robbed Kim Yuna of the gold medal in Sochi in 2014 and this time it is doping Its a disgusting country
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> 2014 Sochi Olympics Yuna Kim should be the gold medalist But they gave it to Sotnikova a Russian  whose scores were undeniably inflated both in the Short Program and Free Skate even if her performancs  recorded underrotation twofooted landing wrongedge and substandard execution compared to Yuna Kim whose performances were almost perfect and done artistically according to her planned programs A lot of people around the world including commentators and great figure skaters expressed injustice but what did IOC do2022 Beijing OlympicsValieva again a Russian figure skating athlete is found to be positive with a banned drug and she is still being allowed to compete What  Even if the drug test was in December 2021 the drug already made its positive effect on her Valieva may not have the full knowledge about this because shes just 15 yo but I believe that somehow Valieva and her parents know something Valieva her coaches and her doctors  should be held liable and should not allow to compete The act of letting her take a banned drug was a premeditated disregard of the rules and law of the sports I admire Valieva upon seeing her performances but justice for all should prevail Shes just 15 yo hence she still has many opportunities in the future Representatives from other countries who tried their best to abide with the rules and regulations and have the potential to win medals should not be punished just because Valieva is allowed to competeThis is another shameful and biased decision from the IOC
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> A sweetener in the deal for Russia to deescalate
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> Compete cleanPunish the coaches
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> When you need 2 month to examine a tube of piss you have NO credibility in whatever crap you come up with
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> She doped and knew it  40 days to get results and to washout of the drug  ROC knows how to dope and washout their athletes before testing  Im sure they all still dope during training  I am sure she is part of it
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> Everyone should just calm down a bit  Let her compete There appears to be at least some uncertainty regarding the results from testing sample A and questions regarding the lab delays and timing  of both submission to the Swedish lab and transmission of results to the IOC  I dont condone the doping attributed to Russian sports in the past But people are to quick to attack a young athlete simply because she is from Russia  What are chances of a false positive test result not unheard of Test sample B If sample B confirms the presence of banned substances and she medals she should be disqualified If she medals and the results from testing sample B are negative for banned substances she should be awarded any medal she might win  I would also look carefully at the chain of custody of any samples tested Could anyone have had access to tamper with them This situation must be thoroughly investigated and this will take more time I do not know what the IOC standard is for resolving the type of violation she is being accused of beyond a reasonable doubt a preponderance of the evidence or what I see in so many comments guilty as accused guilty by reasonable suspicion  or obviously guilty because she is simply too good a skater  Let this talented skater compete  Give officials time to complete additional lab tests and a thorough investigation of this matter including of course an investigation of Kamilas coaching team and team doctors  Good investigators would also look at who might gain most from having such a talented skater disqualified or have her focus disrupted just before the competition  Let Kamila skate and give all the facts time to surface and be evaluated  We need to be fair to all the Olympic competitors including this young lady  Why not award medals provisionally for this upcoming singles figure skating event If it is proven beyond a doubt that Valieva did indeed break the rules by training with or competing while using a banned substance by all means withhold the medals  Under no circumstances can cheating be allowed in Olympic competition  Regarding protected minors competingraise the minimum age to compete at the senior level to 18 so age cannot be used as an excuse There is no excuse for cheating period I hope everyone competing performs at their seasons best Good luck to all athletes
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> What exactly does irreparable harm mean Her feelings get hurt Didnt the Russians bank on her age as the loop hole they would need to escape this because they knew they would get caught again
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> Yay lets ruin womens figure skating
iSZ32irrgtc,<START> FIRST KAMILA VALIEVA AND AFTER figure skatingTHE BEST ATHLETE IN THIS SPORTLOVE FROM GREECE CORRUPTED USA TALK ABOUT DRUGS ITS FUNNYAND FAIRHOW MANY NATIONS KILLED FROM USAIRAKYOGOSLAVIASYRIACYPRUSMAKEDONIAAND SO SO
