kXwFC6lKN7w,<START> But the people must know before what waiting them in that country They should take their own food to China I mean Its a very strange country  Homepets like cats and dogs are beaten to death for make a meal of them Burned alive and such cruel things are there very normal When you travel through the country you will not find any sink in a public toilet So their dont wash their hands   The people spit on the streets without shame You see it everywhere And its only possible to drink water from closed bottles So better dont eat there things that you dont cook by yourself
