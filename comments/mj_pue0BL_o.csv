mj_pue0BL_o,<START> OMG Did the CCP propaganda ever pulled one over on the people watching the Olympicsif even anyone is When you watch the skiers going down the ski jump and doing their aerials you dont get to see about 100 yards away the cooling towers and the sky high smokestacks and the huge boilers Oh yeah I almost forgot theres also the sprinkling of fake snow on the jump ramp The ski jump is built in the middle of a defunct factory zone in Beijing Its a godawful site Please IOC next time you award the winter Olympics to a country please ensure they have mountains and snow and proper facilities for the events and for the athletes PS A water pipe broke in the brand new Olympic athletes quarters sending torrents of water from the upper floors through to the bottom through the walls and light fixtures and electrical outletsThe athletes are getting to see firsthand Chinese tofu construction

mj_pue0BL_o,<START> Finally an Olympic medal in ski jumping I was a big fan of Canadian ski jumping in the late 70s through the 80s watching every possible broadcast of the circuit and Olympics due to Horst Bulau  4 Olympics 29time medalist with 13 Gold on the World circuit Steve Collins my favourite but far less successful only achieving 1 gold and 2 bronze on the circuit and 3 Olympics plus he is Ojibwa which was a minor factor in my appreciationplus a friend of mine was from the same reserve Fort William First Nation is the same age but did not know him but knew some Collins and  to a lesser extent Ron Richards
