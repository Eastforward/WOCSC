o7uLcsSJR3I,<START> Although a few West countries boycott Beijing Olympic China gave a positive and peaceful images To China it doesnt need to audition the West opinion So how one feels is up to how Media interpret it Personally it is much better than shit show media and US government US society is so negative people seem hate each other and neighbor  Protest and culture wars happen everywhere and near daily Honestly I dont know why Americans think themselves exceptional Is this a true democratic society or just in the name only  In true democratic northern European countries people there are happy and love their governments US
o7uLcsSJR3I,<START> I think that China is a PR Lie Factory and the leadership there is very very brutal to their peoples of the same lineage or not  The world knows very well the truth and we are boycotting the China propaganda The Chinese common people seem to be Communists however the Chinese leadership is a Totalitarian Monarchy Dictatorship of the most vicious type China is working on scientific modernization but they are a millennia behind on civility compassion morals ethics and good will Take a lesson from historys King Cyrus the Great We did King Cyrus said Success should always call for showing greater kindness generosity and justice only people lost in darkness treat it as an occasion for greater greed  He also said Whenever you can act as a liberator Freedom dignity wealththese three together constitute the greatest happiness of humanity If you bequeath all three to your people their love for you will never die

o7uLcsSJR3I,<START> The most stupidest thing is to create political noise on  Olympic game to attack other countries Olympic game should be sports only this is respecting athletess hard training even with risk of injury This political noise is not doing anything but distracting peoples attention enjoying athletes performance It is against athletes human right

o7uLcsSJR3I,<START> Of course China knew because Western media including TIME under the aegis of the US has gone nuts to the point of psychosis While accusations of Chinas human rights violations are put on a loop Western media sees nothing wrong with the US robbing Afghanistan of its money as its people are facing famine

o7uLcsSJR3I,<START> The Epoch Times is probably the single largest source of antiChina propaganda in North America It is not journalism as identified for a democratic society  It is funded by wealthy American and Taiwanese who long for the days of dictator Chiang Kai Shek  It mongers in hate and is a master of manipulation and distortion  Otherwise I have no strong opinions and would recommend it for lining your garbage disposal
