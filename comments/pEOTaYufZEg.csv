pEOTaYufZEg,<START> Nice villageOutdoor escalators have not cover from rainsnow Many xinhua live videos dont have many viewers bcoz videos often are shaky making viewers headache
pEOTaYufZEg,<START> Wish China the best success Go ChinaThe hysterical attacks of the West on China show that China is doing too right and too well They have always hoped to destroy this most charming Eastern civilization China needs to be more confident in walking its own path to realizing its dream of common prosperity and a community with a shared future for mankind Dont be distracted or discouraged by the West President Xi is such a graceful and charming person however the West put the most negative spin on describing him as they always do when they talk anything about China Why cannot China get the truth out to the mass in the WestAs I have observed that CGTN has failed so far in telling Chinese stories to the Western audience They have tried very hard to appeal to or please them but forget about what their founding mission is all about This is why so many individual social media content creators mushroomed as they believe that they have to take it into their own hands in telling the real China to the world It is because they love China and they know that the West lies about China on almost every frontI mentioned before and I wish to mention again that the World with Tianwei the Point with Liuxin and the Dialogue with Xuqingduo are repetitive and lack depth and are far from thoughtprovoking They are too shy to praise China when China is worthy of praise They dont themselves believe that China is a democracy how to let their audience believe How did the US let the world believe that they are the best when the fact that they are exactly the opposite It is so obvious that The Summit for Democracy is merely a political stunt yet CGTN has given it such a good run talking about whos invited and whos not and why when they could have paid more attention in condemning the US in killing 10 Afghan innocent civilians including children Isnt it counterproductive to keep repeating that the US let few counties will diplomatic boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics instead the time can be spent wiser in telling how well China is preparing and how much history that China will make Good words worth repeatingI hope to see that China is increasingly confident in leading the way and setting its own agendas instead of defending or reacting to the Western media I wish to see more confident and upright young Chinese joining in telling the China stories with charms depth and thoughtprovoking remarks
