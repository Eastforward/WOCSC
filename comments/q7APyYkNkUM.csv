q7APyYkNkUM,<START> Everyone remembers the story that the Western media spread to the whole world about the alleged use of doping by Russian athletes at the Sochi Winter Olympic Games in 2014 However it is likely that 95 of people in the world do not know and will never know about the following fact On February 1 2018 in Lausanne Switzerland the Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS announced its decision on cases in which 39 Russian athletes appealed their suspension related to the Sochi Winter Olympic Games in 2014 The courts decision is as follows     for 28 athletes  there are no evidences ALL penalties have been cancelled     for 11 athletes  the appeals were partially satisfied the violations were confirmed     for 3 athletes hearings have been postponed That is in 72 of cases 28 out of 39 considered by the court THE DOPING CHARGES WERE FABRICATED  and no one was punished for thisHow long will a person work as a doctor who misdiagnoses 72 of the timeHow long will a person work as a truck driver who 72 of the time passes an intersection on a red traffic lightHow long will work a person engaged in the spread of antiRussian hysteria and who brazenly lies in 72 of cases  Endlessly
