rHByLj9WxMU,<START> Considering China is known for filtering sewage waste to reuse as food oil i wouldnt eat what theyre giving out theyre probably feeding their competitors prison scrap compared to what they feed their country olympians
rHByLj9WxMU,<START> The USA athletes should have stayed home Theres no real natural snow there kinda like Bochi and both had to manufacture snow and thats a problem
rHByLj9WxMU,<START> The Olympics Now Where
rHByLj9WxMU,<START> They think thats bad but thats literally every school meal they are feeding to kids across the country If that goulash is too bad for Olympic athletes whys it acceptable to feed to kids

rHByLj9WxMU,<START> Like anyone should be surprised of horrid conditions in a communist country I was in Bejing for a work project nine years ago put up in a private hotel on a secured campus owned by a nearbillionaire art dealer and living quarters were still somewhat below standards for any American But I will say we were fed extremely well Our hosts warned us about sticking close to them and were always looking out for our safety I can only imagine how much more challenging things might have been if we were completely on our own
