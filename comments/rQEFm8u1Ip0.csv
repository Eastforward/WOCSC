rQEFm8u1Ip0,<START> IMO with all the talking that Yuzuru did about doing the 4A at the Olympics and the amount of attention he brought upon himself I think he backed himself into a corner  He knew his 4A wasnt ready at the Olympics but because hed already said all over the media for a year that its what he was aiming for pride wouldnt allow him to back out of not doing it  Thats just poor tacticswhich is really too bad  He still had a good shot for that bronze  Anyway congrats to the Quad King  Anything less than a gold for him would have been a travesty a false representation of how dominant he has been these past 4 years  Happy for Nathan  Congrats also to Yuma and Shoma
