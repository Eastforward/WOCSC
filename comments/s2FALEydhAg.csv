s2FALEydhAg,<START> What a talanted 15yo figure skater Enjoing her performances Her case is complicated 1 The sample was from december and it took 45 days to announce the results while the normal period is 20 days Just a trace of microdose of the drug a trace So  more questions than answers 2 All other samples are clean 3 She seem not need any drug She is young and strong also it is not an athletic People love her for the artiscism  Also the commete should do their job not pressuring her without media without announces because it is dificult to imagine what damage to her psyche can apply But despite all of the pressure she showed the highest scores right now
s2FALEydhAg,<START> why is she competing good or not  cheating is cheating 15 years old isnt a dumb state of mind
s2FALEydhAg,<START> What a farce please give me a break
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Who said sport was clean
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Russia has a long history of players banned for the same Trimetazidine substance This isnt something new Lol
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Contamination Hmmm
s2FALEydhAg,<START> What a joke
s2FALEydhAg,<START> People cant leave her alone
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Kamila Valieva sample shows 3 substances related to treating heart condition
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Im not buying the mistake story at allIt doesnt make sense
s2FALEydhAg,<START> The female short program is produced by IOC Directed by Eteri  company in collaboration with Russian Skating Federation This production was made possible by CAS in partnership with the Bank of Russia Staring RV whose appearance was made possible by TMZ The awards ceremony is to be announced by the producers once the cheques are cleared by the Bank of Russia
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Funny Valieva made excuses with her grandfathers drug to avoid disciplinary action I dont think she deserves an Olympic medal I feel sorry for the many athletes who trained honestly and participated in the Olympics without doping
s2FALEydhAg,<START> I feel poorly for both her and her competitors and for all the other athletes who believe in clean sport and true competition In her case she has tremendous natural talent obvious drive and dedication yet she fell victim to a corrupt system that wants to ensure certain outcomes instead of bringing out the best of their athletes She was let down by those she thought were supporting her
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Whatever the story is shes doped and that should be enough to ban her from Olympics Any excuses are just pathetic She is not a child and people around her should have guided her to the right way then all this could have not happened Stop trying to come up with petty excuses really not helping her to grow into a responsible ethical human being And please think about other athletes who compete with their pure 100 efforts and performances They worked relentlessly for all their life for this moment just to compete with someone whos doped This is just so unfair All the contestants should have just boycotted and let the doped girl skate alone Worst Olympics ever
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Quote from Madisyn Coxs wiki example of trimetazidine false positive test from contaminationCox was banned from competition for six months after a urine sample taken in February 2018 tested positive for trimetazidine FINA initially reduced her suspension from four years to two years because of Coxs testimony that she did not knowingly ingest the performanceenhancing drug but would not reduce it further without evidence of the source of the trimetazidine8 Upon analysis of both opened and sealed bottles of Cooper Complete Elite Athletic multivitamins the Court of Arbitration for Sport determined that the multivitamins were the source and reduced Coxs suspension to six months The suspension expired on September 3 20189 However as United States Swimming World Championship trials occurred during her suspension Cox was not able to qualify for the 2019 World Aquatics Championships10
s2FALEydhAg,<START> My opinion Any event where winners are debated by people  not by time is really just a game To many judgmental rules are involved This bares no interest at all But most Olympic events that are use time to dictate the winners are the true sport That competitive angled edge defines a contest
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Cheater
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Yes I also empty my daily vitamin pills into someone elses HEART MEDICINE Very very common

s2FALEydhAg,<START> Doping as a trivial offence nowadays Shocking
s2FALEydhAg,<START> Are they really going to try and claim that this skater accidentally took THREE of her grandfathers heart medication Thats the best excuse her coaches could come up Its so stupid that its just another insult to every other clean skater and clean athlete at the games If she medals there will be no ceremony So none of the women medalists with get their moment to stand on that podium Something they work their whole lives for The Americans won the silver medal in team skating and they dont get their moment because of her and her coaches It is going to years for skating to recover from this mess they made It was so simple If you dope you are banned
