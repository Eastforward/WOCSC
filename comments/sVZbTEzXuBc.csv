sVZbTEzXuBc,<START> What major bullshit comment She was positive the first days of january missed out 2 worldcups to entirely recovery and test negatieve as the rules request Otherwise she would never have been able to get on  the plane to Bejing as the restrictions are very strictAs you know spend some time  with your girlfriend  is not a goal for an olympian training years for this event Assuming this post is made for manipulating is only possible fir people who dont understand the emotionele rollercoaster of this girl  Besides this it was NOT mentioned in the guidelines There was mentioned that after 2 neg tests within at least 24 h  they are released  Not to mention that there was a recovery document the bloodsamples prooving her antibodies no whatsoever symptoms and neg testing Kim is the most honest human being Stop assuming she is a manipulating piece of shitShe was very happy excited and full of positivity towards this games

sVZbTEzXuBc,<START> The village is awesome and high tech there are robots everywhere the rooms are nice everything is nice and clean food and laundry is free What is there to compain about Many people in China dont have any food to eat and live in total misery and you complain about food been the same Madam you are having a very good lifebe grateful for what you have I wish my room was as nice as the one you have and with free house keeper to clean up after my room The korean restaurant in the village has free food tell someone to get food from them to give you or maybe if someone brings you food from a super market you can cook them in your room Sorry that place is not a palace Dont expect every place you go to be a palace You can get the virus without wearing masks and if you kiss people in the face and they kiss you Now concentrate on getting better so you can compete in a few weeks and dont think about all the bad things around you many things are nice in there
