ui3vlvpG6Ec,<START> That was definitely better than Sochi of 2014 I never really watched it on tv but on you tube   Plus I was busy with the horn lesson l my moms illness and Teddy the labradoodle And it never really came to my mind that the dominant skaters were Asians and Russians I did watch the Olympics of 2002 and other figure skating championships on tv  My mom loved Ice skating as a child  I took ice skating too until I had problems with arthritis and my spine  You know its hard to skate with arthritis
ui3vlvpG6Ec,<START> The Native America tribute was lovely
