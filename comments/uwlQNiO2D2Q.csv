uwlQNiO2D2Q,<START> Lets be real these athletes compete for China cuz China gives them more  This is the ONLY real reason Its absurd that these athletes can keep their dual citizenship when my parents BORN RAISED AND WORKED in China have to abandon their Chinese citizenship to become Canadian They cant even go back to China to see their elderly parents during covid cuz China closed its borders to all nonChinese people Competing for China these athletes have to say nice things about China and this is how China advertises itself But REAL CHINESE people know what China is all about cynicism
uwlQNiO2D2Q,<START> Plenty of anti china here Im quoting one Malaysian hereIm from Malaysia China has traded with Malaysia for 2000 years In those years they had been the worlds biggest powers many times Never once they sent troops to take our l4nd Admiral Zhenghe came to Malacca five times in gigantic fleets and a flagship eight times the size of Christopher Columbus flagship Santa Maria He could have seized Malacca easily but he did not In 1511 the Portuguese came In 1642 the Dutch came In the 18th century the British came We were colonised by each one after another When China wanted spices from India they traded with the Indians When they wanted gems they traded with the Persian They didnt take lands The only time China expanded beyond their current borders was in Yuan Dynasty when Genghis and his descendants Ogedei Khan Guyuk Khan  Kublai Khan concurred China Mid Asia and Eastern Europe Yuan Dynasty although being based in China was a part of the Mongolian Empire Then came the Century of Humiliation Britain smuggled opium into China to dope the population a strategy to turn the trade deficit around after the British could not find enough silver to pay the Qing Dynasty in their tea and porcelain trades After the opium warehouses were burned down and ports were closed by the Chinese in ordered to curb opium the British started the Opium War I which China lost Hong Kong was forced to be surrendered to the British in a peace talk Nanjing Treaty The British owned 90 of the opium market in China during that time Queen Victoria was the worlds biggest drug baron The remaining 10 was owned by American merchants from Boston Many of Bostons institutions were built with profit from opiumAfter 12 years of Nanjing Treaty the West started getting really really greedy The British wanted the Qing government 1 To open the borders of China to allow goods coming in and out freely and tax free 2 Make opium legal in China Insane requests Qing government said no The British and French with supports from the US started Opium War II with China which again China lost The AngloFrench military raided the Summer Palace and threatened to burn down the Imperial Palace the Qing government was forced to pay with ports free business zones 300000 kilograms of silver and Kowloon was taken Since then Chinas resources flew out freely through these business zones and ports In the subsequent amendment to the treaties Chinese people were sold overseas to serve as labor In 1900 China suffered attacks by the 8National Alliance Empire of Japan Russian Empire British Empire including India France USA Germany Italy AustriaHungary Innocent Chinese civilians in Peking Beijing now were murdered buildings were destroyed  women were raped The Imperial Palace was raided and treasures ended up in museums like the British Museum in London and the Louvre in Paris In late 1930s China was occupied by the Japanese in WWII Millions of Chinese died during the occupancy 300000 Chinese died in Nanjing Massacre alone Mao brought China together again from the shambles There were peace and unity for some time But Maos later reign saw sufferings and deaths from famine and power struggles Then came Deng Xiao Ping and his infamous bl4ckcat and wh1tecat story His preference in pragmatism than ideologies has transformed China This thinking allowed China to evolve all the time to adapt to the actual needs in the country instead of rigidly bounded to ideologies It also signified the death of Communism in actually practice in China The current SocialismMeritocracyMarket Economy model fits the Chinese like gloves and it propels the uprise of China Singapore has a similar model and has been arguably more successful than Hong Kong because Hong Kong being gateway to China was riding on the economic boom in China while Singapore had no one to gain from In just 30 years the CPC have moved 800 millions of people out from poverty The rate of growth is unprecedented in human history They have built the biggest mobile network by far the biggest high speed rail network in the world and they have become a behemoth in infrastructure They made a fishing village called Shenzhen into the worlds second largest technological centre after the Silicon Valley They are growing into a technological power house It has the most elaborate ecommerce and cashless payment system in the world They have launched exploration to Mars The Chinese are living a good life and China has become one of the safest countries in the world The level of patriotism in the country has reached an unprecedented height For all of the achievements the West has nothing good to say about it China suffers from intense ant1China propagandas from the West Western Media used the keyword Communist to instil fear and hatred towards China Everything China does is negatively reported They claimed China used slave labor in making iPhones The truth was Apple was the most profitable company in the world it took most of the profit leave some to Foxconn a Taiwanese company and little to the labor They claimed China was inhuman with onechild policy At the same time they accused China of polluting the earth with its huge population The fact is the Chinese consume just 30 of energy per capita compared to the US They claimed China underwent ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang The fact is China has a policy which priorities ethnic minorities For a long time the ethnic minorities were allowed to have two children and the majority Han only allowed one The minorities are allowed a lower score for university intakes There are 39000 mosque in China and 2100 in the US China has about 3 times more mosque per musl1m than the US When terrorist attacks happened in Xinjiang China had two choices 1 Reeducate the Uighur CENSUDED by Youtube before they turned CENSUDED by Youtube Here I could not copy the exact word since today it is censored by YouTube if I write it next to the indicated ethnicity It is the one used to identify those crazy people who are killing people thinking that by doing this they will be able to go to paradise 2 Let them be after they launch attacks and killed innocent people bomb their homes China chose 1 to solve problem from the root and not to do killing How the US solve terrorism Fire missiles from battleships drop bombs from the sky During the pandemic When China took extreme measures to lockdown the people they were accused of being inhuman When China recovered swiftly because of the extreme measures they were accused of lying about the actual numbers When Chinas cases became so low that they could provide medical support to other countries they were accused of politically motivated Western Media always have reasons to bash China Just like any country there are irresponsible individuals from China which do b4d things but the China government overall has done very well But I hear this comment over and over by people from the West I like Chinese people but the CPC is evil What they really want is the Chinese to change the government because the current one is too good Fortunately China is not a multiparty democratic country otherwise the opposition party in China will be supported by notorious NGOs NonGovernment Organization of the USA like the NED National Endowment for Democracy to topple the ruling party The US and the British couldnt crack Mainland China so they work on Hong Kong Of all the exBritish colonial countries only the Hong Kongers were offered BNOs by the British Because the UK would like the Hong Kongers to think they are British citizens not Chinese A divideandconquer strategy which they often used in Color Revolutions around the world They resort to low drty tricks like detaining Huaweis CFO  banning Huawei They raised a silly trade war which benefits no one Trade deficit always exist between a developing and a developed country USA is like a luxury car seller who ask a farmer why am I always buying your vegetables and you havent bought any of my cars When the Chinese were making socks for the world 30 years ago the world let it be But when Chinese started to make high technology products like Huawei and DJI it caused redalert Because when Western and Japanese products are equal to Chinese in technologies they could never match the Chinese in prices First world countries want China to continue in making socks Instead of stepping up themselves they want to pull China down The recent movement by the US against China has a very important background When Libya Iran and China decided to ditch the US dollar in oil trades Gaddafis was killed by the US Iran was being sanctioned by the US and now its Chinas turn The US has been printing money out of nothing The only reason why the US Dollar is still widely accepted is because its the only currency which oil is allowed to be traded with The US has an agreement with Saudi that oil must be traded in US dollar ONLY Without the petroldollar status the US dollars will sink and America will fall Therefore anyone trying to disobey this order will be eliminated China will soon use a goldbacked cryptocurrency the alarms in the White House go off like mad Chinas achievement has been by hard work Not by looting the world I have deep sympathy for China for all the suffering but now I feel happy for them China is not rising they are going back to where they belong Good luck China This message has been censored on YouTube I replaced some letters of the text with numbers to avoid the YT algorithm
