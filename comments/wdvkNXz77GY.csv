wdvkNXz77GY,<START> In My Opinion it should be down to the individual athlete to decide which country they complete for without political or racial harassment What do you think
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Emotional damaged
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Anyone born in the US with one or both parents with a foreign nationalitynationalities automatically receives an American nationality until they turn adults then they get to choose their own nationality it is that simple Familywise Eileen Gu was raised by her mom and grandma as a soleparent family and solely influenced by her Chinese family and soaked with Chinese culture Therefore no matter how many more environmental factors there are around her in her external life she will reasonably recognize herself more as a Chinese girl there is nothing too surprising
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> You wanna see a magic trick This comment will get deleted lickity split Your are a ccp shill How much do they pay you to post this shit
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Shell get 10 social credit points for each gold medal
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> My biggest question iswhere will she live moving forward  Is she going to try and come back to the USA  At the end of the day it is definitely her free choice but some decisions have MAJOR consequences as she is swiftly learningThe biggest issue is her choosing to support a communist government that oppresses her people the way China does  Very sad
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Can anyone with a parent from China pick up a second passport then  There is a lot confusion here
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Shes in the news becous vpn is on the appstore  And she cant really compete for china becous she has a American sitizenship But CCP needs her for propaganda so she got the green card
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Once everything is done Eileen Gu will go home to US and hang the gold medal on her wall and I bet she will never think of being a chinese citizen for even 1 second Why would anyone want to emigrate to china Its the other way around Even CCP members want to move to US if they can if they can figure out a way to take their money out of China
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Smart guys know how to choose that is all
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Talented ones like Eileen are world citizen They can make their own choice to compete for any country
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> She has a bright future good for her want to inspire millions of young girls all over the world
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> PS please take your mom with you Always keep family together
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Chinas already angry at her for breaking the laws Lmao CHINESE Government is down on her for using SOCIAL  media apps that are forbidden Chinas citizens are angry at her and  very jealous that she has the freedom the americans do to use what ever app she feels like  She entitled to do so wether China likes it Or NOT SHES CHINAS RISING STAR SHES THEIR TRUE WINNER AMERICAN BORN BRED IN AMERICA TRAINED IN AMERICA BY AMERICANS WHAT A LUCKY traiter
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Agreed  You have very decent insightful comments about Eileens right choice  God bless Eileen Gu away from those racistnonsense attacks
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> The only issue is that China denies duel citizenship
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> She has been representing China since 2019
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> Ultimately the decision lies with the athlete No one disputes that Eileen was born and raised in the US enjoying all the privileges of what America can offer good coaches training venues sporting opportunities etc decide to compete for China That is her right She is a personable young woman a wellgrounded teenager she is living the life with sponsors like Louis Vitton Tiffany etc she gets to travel freely go to the best school Her noble ambition is to inspire young people in China to take up skiing and set up herself as the poster girl and inspiration All well and good But there is one factor that comes with her move She is giving credibility to the Communist Regime and Xi Jinpings CCP which carries out genocide organ harvesting brutalizes races that it deems inferior brutalizes its own people that dont toe the line This regime glorifies winners and bullies and torments and mocks failures Her reasons for joining China seem noble and well intended but with it comes the perception she is endorsing supporting and crediting the CCP and Xi Jinping Her mother with strong ties to the CCP also doesnt hurt    Are Louis Vitton and Tiffany comfortable with the knowledge that their girl is supporting endorsing and have close ties with Xi and CCP What will the world think of them with this knowledge
wdvkNXz77GY,<START> I was def bothered by her decision not to represent the country thats given her everything but the point you made about her inspiring millions of young people in China is a great one
