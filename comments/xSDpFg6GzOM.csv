xSDpFg6GzOM,<START> Im confused a bit  He says there is no steering mechanism then comments a bit later about how hitting the wall cost himSo either they can steer and avoid the wallor I assume maybe the announcer just means the sled itself has no mechanism but that the rider can steer with body weight maybeIf thats the case than the athlete IS the steering mechanismand hes what trying to infer they have no controlDont get me wrong either this shit is nutty P  However being intentionally misleading is badand if it wasnt intentional he needs more experience castingthen again maybe that is why he is casting the Skeleton
