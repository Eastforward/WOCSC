xZxoAcDeX9g,<START> Complaints about the food inside the closed loop have been mounting with athletes media and other personnel posting on social media about the lack of quality variety or healthy choices at the available restaurants including the canteen at the Main Media Centre MMC One hotel manager even admitted to CNN that the food in one of their own restaurants is disgusting Fresh fruit is hard to find and no snack items or hot food are allowed to be delivered to guests into the bubble from outside The only shop in the MMC sells lowquality packaged snacks a small number of toiletry items and Chinese beer  and the shelves are often halfempty Those who were able to visit Beijing before the pandemic have lamented their disappointment about the poor choices available in a city that is famous for its excellent food Even the muchtouted robotpowered restaurant at the MMC is often overcrowded with people taking videos for social media and they warn customers that it could take 40 minutes to be served And despite the robotpowered food delivery system  which lowers plates of food via a wire from purple pods that slide along the ceiling  the rest of the operation still runs in a far less futuristic way with customers paying in cash or credit card at the till and staff in some sections handdelivering the trays of lukewarm dumplings that were made by the robots The robot cocktail bar is often closed and on several visits the machines had run out of ingredients so the staff on site reverted to making the drinks the oldfashioned way The dinner buffet at the ShangriLa Hotel  which includes good quality Chinese dishes and international options  and the restaurant at the Marco Polo Hotel are among the only places inside the closed loop escaping major criticism of their food But they come at a cost  notably a price tag of more than 60 per head for the ShangriLa buffet
