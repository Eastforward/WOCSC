yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> These two jokes supported sotnikova who double footed a landing couldnt perform a lutz on the outside edge just like lipinski and prerotated and under rotated every single jump over Yuna who skated 2 near perfect programs in sochi They have NO ROOM to be furious over anything Theyre both jokes in the skating world
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> Where all of you were at the last OlympicsWhen Simone biles had the same issue and she was called a hero Double standards why Because when US is wrong nobody thinks its bad but when is the enemy of US is all its horrible
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> Tara and Johnny are commentators not judges
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> All international broadcasters didnt comments anything during her short program
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> childish
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> I understand what they are coming from and what is happening right now while its still ongoing not only affects them but also the whole skating community as a whole which it was awkward to say the least
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> I think as commentators Tara and Johnny should have done their jobs and not taken this so personal  I think they were wrong  Maybe there is a clause in their contract that says they can OPT OUT if a skater had  a bad drug test or they simply dont like what country theyre from    idk
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> Funny that the investigation is nowhere completed but all yall are experts sitting in judgement of someone whose guilt youre somehow privy to spearheaded by Weir and Lipinski of all people How sad
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> The whole world no longer trusts WADA Why doping scandal at this particular time Where was WADA two months before And this is not the first case of this corrupt organization Why are practically all drugs manufactured in Russia banned Although our pharmaceutists prove that many drugs are not doping
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> What a shame that a positive doping athlete was allowed to compete in the olympics Insane
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> They are not protesting Valieva they are protesting against hte systemic doping  cheating environment that allows a positive doping athlete to slip through the cracks and actually compete
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> I feel sorry for the other skaters
yUhqDzb64ZI,<START> Lipinski and Weir arent opposers of Valieva They are former elite competitive skaters and professional skating commentators credibly speaking about the impact this doped skater is having on the sport and these entire games The IOC which should be concerned about the health dangers of their condoning doped skating and should have sent her home to be monitored by a doctor  isnt responsibly adhering to its own motto All of this makes the broadcasting of this Olympic short program very hard  for everyne but doping caught again Russia
