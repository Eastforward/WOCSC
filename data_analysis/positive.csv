go putin,1
great imagination but incredibly delusional looking at this anchor stupid face is fun though in  seek solace to calm themselves,1
russia will not help india if india go to war with china or pakistan  buying weapons from russia will not mean anything to russia,1
the russians do not need to worry about india looking at russian territory and saying these lands are historically indian and we want these lands back but that is not true with china who has already mentioned that part of the russian far east was taken from china in an unjust treaty and is historically theirs      russia is also in a difficult position with china in that russia is right now isolated in the world and facing a deeper isolation if it invades ukraine so it needs china    but you can bet that china views russia as the subordinate in this relationship something that cannot sit well with putin   at the same time while i think it is important for india to maintain its historical ties with russia  political future lies with the quad     russia has given tacit support to  attempts to annex the south china sea and to eventually annex taiwan in exchange for  support of  potential invasion of ukraine and its political battle with nato     russia needs china right now but is competing directly with,1
simply  keep your friends close and your enemy closer  do not trust russia,1
question india gives its loyalty to russia but if india has to go to war with china will russia give its loyalty to india whose side do you think russia will be on my guess is russia will opt out to defend india and take a neutral position just like india did if the world falls apart who will come to assist india if they need help russia will never go against china to defend india be careful of how you choose your friends because they can easily become your enemy,1
china wants to be totalitarian master of the planet putting russia at the rear of ever decision surely putin knows this,1
putin has a war to plan,1
not even can come between russia and india time tested friendship no hidden agenda in the friendship,1
amazing that putin can be friends with china and india 2 great countries how can that be seen as a negative,1
what it really tells you is that both china and russia put themselves before all others including their so called partners,1
putin makes bold statements with sheets of silence,1

dear miss  why do you name yourself  is it because your chinese friends and colleagues having difficulty pronounce your chinese name  and you do not want them to butcher your beautiful chinese name that actually has a meaning rather than just a sound in the air or is it because one of your parents is caucasian please kindly answer my question as i have been searching for this answer for quite sometime but i still cannot crack the code of this  enigmatic love for anything western from chinese people while at the same time the west hate anything chinese with a passion this is bizarre you know because even a stranded dog lives not far from my home  knows how to walk away when a pack of arrogant  dogs  reject him,1

micro  from moving the head too quickly are a thing well that explains a lot all that  i did to heavy metal music in the 90s is haunting me now,1
going for a stroll you experience variations in g force throughout the step standing still you experience,1
i am 4 seconds into the video isnt every winter sport a sliding sport,1
all the sports is dangerous so if you dont want expose dont play its so easy,1
im  get some sled head ya feel me,1
i have those  and never did the sport,1
210 nothing that a juice cleanse and some  water cant solve,1
all well and good  start any  with boxing,1
even if u dont win a medal just being there is an achievement enduring what each sports does to an athletes body definitely something i cant go through,1
uh you dont have to call it hidden we know  is ing dangerous,1
i was surprised there was no mention of how sled head looks similar to  found in football players  some  sufferers never had terrible   rather it was the repeated blows to the helmet from hands and elbows etc over time as well as the jarring of the head as the body gets hit,1
corona is fa ke bs,1
your channel should be ashamed of not calling this  by the way no human being is bigger than environment western media made issues out of beds,1
important for us i am from  bangladesh i am ur big fan today,1
good  thoughts   thank you     japanese,1
this is the only olympics where we got to see the more of the olympic village than ever thank to the youtube and,1
japan did a great job keeping in mind the pandemic  and  a clean and  environment,1
great video but obnoxious music,1
the olympic village in vancouver is now rental apartments and  condos with various structural problems i am not surprised because i worked on one building for  the things i saw during construction were amazing rushing to get all those buildings done in a flash compromised the final result  i would not recommend buying a condo in the complex its pretty but,1
i heard they are all getting laid,1
every single room of those tokyo bay water front apartments are sold before the olympic begins those will not be abandoned as they are located in one of the most expensive area of tokyo,1
i think everyone should appreciate  during a pandemic crisis would there be a olympic or world record this year if japan were not able to run the olympic in this pandemic time god bless,1
seriously japanese know how to utilize every resource available  they will use olympic village very wisely,1
yes you are now watching 2000  cardboard,1

i wish all americans would see videos like these from western athletes who appreciate the beauty efficiency warmth friendliness and spirit of the beijing olympics so they could get a fair sense of this great event put on by the chinese people  unfortunately many americans have been persuaded by the propaganda and hatred and have thus denied themselves the beauty of this olympics due to their hatred and gullibility  no problem because most of the world no longer gives a damn what america thinks or is deceived by the hatred and manipulation that the west pushes,1

why would a video like this be posted on youtube,1
it makes sense not to bring your cell phone,1
more than 10 years  i took the train in new york for the first  an american uncle asked me what do you think of new  i was very disappointed,1
the videos shot by american athletes are more realistic and believable and accurate than the american ones lol,1
what does the second half have to do with the winter  i want to see foreigners surprised to see the country develop to this level,1
congratulations eileen gu,1
one can certainly preach their value but must stop short of dictating ones life respect goes to eileen,1

doping russia,1
i would just come home america  this is not fair  you take an oath to be honest and truthful in your experience,1
players from other countries who played fairly without doping are the biggest  is unfair,1
doping cheater russian quality,1
olympic junkie simon  check in more often leave camille,1
come on  we are with you,1
player who violate doping cannot compete in the   players efforts and dreams are equally precious,1
her parents need to get her out of that country and train somewhere else safer and without scandal she can still represent her country,1
if  ever helped her train with better endurance all of it effects are null and void given what   went through before her event in og i d say that her training on olympic ice was diminished to the point that it will have negative consequences on her performance on the day of i wish her the best,1
anya  the best is axiom and uncles and aunts from the ioc can do everything,1
everybody is worried about her and not the real medal owners who had a plenty of dreams duh,1
when the world gives you a second chance and you dope again  seriously no more giving into russia and their influence slaps on the wrist wont do it for them,1
this girl does not need doping she is a skating miracle she took medication for  in december thats all,1
i would hate to see that sweet young person punished for this i hope they just go after the villains who slipped her the drug,1
vladimir put in official approval for children to be given drugs to enhance their performance child exploitation,1
you cannot accept the fact that 3 of our girls hold all the prizes in the world  everyone knows who pays these vadas and everyone else you accuse us of doping while your women in sports look like pumped mutants stop lying to yourself already,1
they may not have won an olympic medal in 2022 but theirs will be the performance i remember and come back to watch over and over,1
great team awesome,1
thank you for your wonderful program it was truly a pleasure to watch  ive already watched it 3 times loved your smiles too,1
i was truly impressed by these two players performances they were creative and artists,1
best wishes to chock  bates for the  gold medal,1
these two are an incredible team their concern and affection for one another is palpable they are truly one on the ice and off their work ethic and their mutual respect for one another will provide the strength and stamina they need they have great courage and compassion madison chock and evan bates are perfect representatives for the us and i for one am very proud of them and wish them the best god bless them and keep them safe,1
ya good luck china killed its own  for raising voice against  viruses its own citizens treated like prisons killed its own soldiers and doesnt even care here its shameless selling merchandise to promote winter olympics which is going to be a super spreader if  viruses new and latest,1

it is normal for north korea not to come because it is banned from the  as for the  it will not affect the opening of the olympic  on the  too much epidemic prevention pressure will be great,1
as a  18  officials are going to the winter olympics,1
you accent is too heavy to stem this line this line has no future you should allow the entire national language to say a bit more standard,1
kim  is not your average leader and let's be honest he's got some skills,1
north korea's not going to the winter olympics is a disgrace,1
wisdom lies in the great  humor,1
eyebrow distance eye is far which clan,1
buns can't be very healthy,1
just because we are both communist  we know more about how terrible the communist lies are,1
north korea didn't participate in the tokyo olympics because they were going to be shot if they found out about the virus,1

interview original in  how do you feel right  hasnt sunk in yet but this has been my dream since my childhood and it has finally come true i am so happy that i was able to deliver what i have been imagining and training for all this long time and it is amazing that my little brother  was also there to compete in the olympics and to share this moment and witness me win it means a lot for both of us brothers and for me it was essential that i was able to deliver all the tricks and excellence i have always wanted to deliver i was not convinced by the score given for my 2nd run but i was able to handle it and have my frustration express itself through my best performance which i am very happy  so after knowing the score for your 2nd run you were in a mode like  nail it again  i would say there was no tension it was rather how do i say this i was in a totally focused state even more so than usual and i was just there determined,1
congratulations,1
,1
is an icon shaun white is a legend,1
congrats to all winners,1
congrats   the score for his perfect 2nd run was ridiculously low but he just took it with silent determination and showed again that he was the best by his 3rd run which was again flawless technically the most difficult and even higher than the 2nd run imagine what his 2nd run score would have been if he were a smith from the usa,1
big congratulations,1

very good,1
what a beautiful  what a wonderful china,1

the truth about finland's winter olympics in beijing,1
super funny  quality,1
some people eat smoke,1
solved it was the sprinkler system on the ceiling that triggered the sprinkler,1
you can tell it's a frozen fire hose and the temperature goes up and the water goes off and it won't go off until it's done that's something people in the south don't know about,1
china makes rubbish no matter people or things pitiful,1
the first half of the video of beijing olympic workers disinfecting at the gate of the olympic village was connected to the video of the leaking water in the tokyo olympic media center  if it were  the world media would have reported it,1
the leaking film may have been taken from the tokyo olympics,1
the real world is all about  and trying every dirty trick in the world to win,1
is it a beautiful woman that never leaks,1
play a big game,1
picking,1
don't spread  don't  don't hand knives to foreign  how can you be sure that this is the  village and water pipes will not burst in new china under the leadership of the communist party,1
milk slippery,1
how dare the chinese laugh at the paper beds in the olympic village in tokyo when the pipes burst in beijing,1
it's amazing how much information the water is leaking and how much harmony there is inside the walls,1
our party's wise,1
the story behind it is heartwarming,1
,1
china always claims everything to theirs,1
chinese traditional clothes are mao suit because mao terminated all traditional chinese clothes,1
culture stealing has been a new trend by the chinese media and government in the past few years china isnt only doing this to south korea but even to japan vietnam mongolia and many other asian countries,1
as a matter of fact nobody in china even care about  it belongs to korea just like pizza is from italy  is derived from ancient chinese clothing refined and independently developed by koreans it belongs to korea fair enough but its also traditional costume for chinese  koreans china is a multiethnic country the han people dont wear  chinese minorities dont wear  its only among the  you should allow chinese koreans to wear their traditional clothes anytime anywhere they want,1

funny most reports from athletes from all over the world make youtube videos and was pleased with facility and atmosphere however there are some crying in the quarantine room due to them being infected with  19 we  for her but what to do she cannot mix with the olympic village and spread  19 to other healthy athletes there are a lot of hardworking  that are ready to  this  been to china olympics and report us back the truth i doubt  video is fake news u report this video as hate speech and a thumbs down,1
i would not understand that you are the ancestors of liu  and   the uneducated chinese who copy other people's data and judge discretions as kind of,1
china should do the same in future sports event held in democratic countries awash with freedom,1

xia bi,1
john squatting or cheap mai shiva and big sky bristles  days going out side  uses a meal down  i use it like i used to move ahead and fun thing's  but if your,1
if you disagree it mean you supports the independence of hong kong taiwan  mongolia and tibet,1
where can i buy the cushion online,1
i hat china   china 19,1
i love china,1
olympic game of the china by the china for the china,1
be careful that your personal information will be stolen by chinese communist,1
new rules for the beijing olympics 1 if a korean player runs ahead of a chinese player he or she is disqualified 2 if a korean player overtakes a player from another country he or she will be disqualified 3 the judges decisions will always be consistently on the side of china lastly the 2022 beijing olympics are a playground in china or a sports competition in china,1
shame on you,1
made in china,1
chinese,1
sports fest,1
there's a bug in there,1
fucking xi  china,1
and his allies are declared persona non  at the beijing 2022 winter olympics participating countries,1
free hongkong,1
i dont watch the ugly chinese olympics gather chinese minorities to host the olympics,1
chinese listen carefully thats not the olympic chinese  this is chinese festival this is olympics is not china,1
is bandits,1
expel the netherlands  reporter and classify him as persona non,1
barbaric and impolite european journalist,1
i think those who disobey the regulations of the organizers of the winter olympic games and the epidemic prevention work should be disqualified and deported,1
it is an open secret that many european and american journalists and some athletes went to the east olympics with assignments to create a black china big news and received awards from the american human rights association ranging from  to  euros,1
the dutch journalist would have been beaten half to death in the us if he had not been shot by the police on the spot  a fact everyone who lives in the us knows,1
dutch  dry,1
if only he hadn't been arrested as a terrorist,1
play the nos card,1
western journalists think of themselves as human  ambassadors of god and the embodiment of freedom,1
foreign journalists are   freedom of the press means freedom to lie and destroy,1
the current international situation has been slandering and smearing china's image by some countries led by the united  they are not in china for the purpose of participating in the winter olympics,1
nos is a national government  not purely private  rtl is a purely private enterprise,1
my god  olympics in korea was the best,1
i want you to come to the   winter olympics for a great,1
are you sure you took your shoes off in the room,1
thats awesome,1
i thought  was from germany or belgium and is the  only to be proud of the netherlands dutch people advertise  everywhere,1
you made it to south korea,1
awesome video,1
the red one called  in korean,1
fish is called sea squirt,1
yeah those dutch can party,1
you shouldve taken koreas pride super fast train  from the  international airport to  chang direct  takes you to  chang in only an hour at the super fast speed of over  much faster than the bus the  station is right up at the airport you couldve easily asked for the direction to  platform from any korean in the airport try the super fast super modern  next time,1
korea bbq good,1
thanks for the video the alien thing is called   it is called a sea squirt i know it is,1
the view is so awesome,1
welcome to south korea,1
korean  first japanese  came from korea and the weird things in the water tank is sea squirt it  has low calorie and is the one of nutritional seafood anyway have a good time in korea,1
lol so cute,1
200 million comments you counted  take the wind well the average chinese are not so bad,1
this should not be the reason for her to be attacked by the  it is a pity that many people cannot see such a deep and even more regrettable that they cannot speak freely,1
fang brick this episode i absolutely can not agree with your point of view zhu yi won the united states  she is very likely to represent the united states in the world  she is much higher than chen  i carefully watch the video of the two  zhu  strength performance and the completion of the movement is indeed higher than chen has a significant  we are  but we must be in the reason,1
some people say that the football association was bribed by the news recently also said to kick the fake  but type here to recall before every situation is not ruled out is not sure but not by bribery this belly meat really can  they do not understand the ball i played in the olympic sports a little bit,1
fake snow permanently pollutes beijing winter olympics sellout chinese people draw rip off the poor rogue countries to participate in the disaster of the winter olympics,1
why does an athlete who has not been trained for many  an olympic athlete who has not achieved good results in the  make mistakes continuously in the  what is the reason behind  we outsiders cannot know if we really have to guess by  can we also guess whether the athlete was distracted by peng  before the competition and confess,1
it must have been an american,1
is it the fault of the chinese winter olympics to say so much,1
black china can keep the remnants of the false superiority of the  people watching and smiling,1
beijing winter olympics mind corruption limbs developed zhu yi refueling,1
support zhu yi everyone has a hard time growing up,1
poor bastard who won the  division championship when he was 16,1
say a word of grotesque disgust,1
soon there will be news about athlete complaining food ruining their forms in games   chinese  conspiracy how dirty   lol,1
see this for yourself in the clip below  a honest response from athletes commenting on the food the  protocol and the venues guess which team they are  surprise at all they are the people who genuinely uphold the olympic spirit of friendship solidarity and fair,1
i pray for human rights of chinese people no more massacres no more dictators no more tortures no more  wish peace and love on china with  someday and also freedom on hongkong  tibet and so on long time ago china was great i heard but theres no such country anymore theres only the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now i hope china born again this time bc i know some good people  save china,1
knowing that you athletes go to compete why bringing  to beijing of courses those unhealthy bodies need to  or you people spread to  healthy athletes  volunteers as well as those who work at the venues would of  people always find faults to complaints no matter how good they prepared  planned i would suggest that china will never host  olympic games because it is only for the ioc making plenty of money for selling the rights to show the games  the ceremonies there were no tickets sales to the indoor games because of  you people should be grateful that china host the game it is way better than the tokyo summer olympic in  in japan,1
i would not go,1
china,1
the us should have never sent our athletes to these games,1
go and sue the olympics committee for    or gold medals,1
everyone comedown this olympic is made in china  what are you thinking,1
the food looks trashy the athletes trained so hard to get there that is not the way they should be treated dont play with the food at least,1
chinese being chinese they copy korean culture and japanese  they steal medal  yeah corona being corona,1
even prisoners got a better food then athletes in china,1
hater chanel,1
,1
so the complaints about the food inside the closed loop have been mounting with athletes media and other personnel posting on social media about the lack of quality variety or healthy choices at the available restaurants including the canteen at the main media centre  one hotel manager even admitted to cnn that the food in one of their own restaurants is disgusting fresh fruit is hard to find and no snack items or hot food are allowed to be delivered to guests into the bubble from outside the only shop in the  sells  packaged snacks a small number of  items and chinese beer  and the shelves are often  those who were able to visit beijing before the pandemic have lamented their disappointment about the poor choices available in a city that is famous for its excellent food even the   restaurant at the  is often overcrowded with people taking videos for social media and they warn customers that it could take 40 minutes to be served and despite the  food delivery system  which lowers plates of food via a wire from purple pods that slide along the ceiling,1
on a scale of 0 to 10 the athletes are giving the beijing 2022 olympics 6 complaints about the food inside the closed loop have been mounting with athletes media and other personnel posting on social media about the lack of quality variety or healthy choices at the available restaurants including the canteen at the main media centre  one hotel manager even admitted to cnn that the food in one of their own restaurants is disgusting fresh fruit is hard to find and no snack items or hot food are allowed to be delivered to guests into the bubble from outside the only shop in the  sells  packaged snacks a small number of  items and chinese beer  and the shelves are often  those who were able to visit beijing before the pandemic have lamented their disappointment about the poor choices available in a city that is famous for its excellent food even the   restaurant at the  is often overcrowded with people taking videos for social media and they warn customers that it could take 40 minutes to be served and despite the  food delivery system  which lowers plates,1
before i came to china i never understood how the word freedom could be perceived in so many different ways have you had any experience which really opened up your eyes to this fact,1
freedom is not when the world police,1
what free is you want,1
freedom comes after order spiritually those who enter heaven literally after death are those who have followed some universal laws of karma be good people the universe is in perfect order freedom doesnt mean we can do whatever we want but more of that our souls are free from suffering,1
the winter olympics showed that china has eliminated the virus because in the eyes of the chinese people have more responsibility than freedom everyone has a responsibility to keep everyone else safe and they did,1
in  right have the ability to say the address will be at your door,1
says freedom and get this under control,1
well said,1
there really is no freedom in china,1
do you think what will happen if china rule the world,1
i am a  love my country,1
love from china,1
when all westerners are discussing whether china is free or not and whether to save the  can they ask us chinese whether we want your  freedom  this is a lack of respect for how to do unto others what one does not want oneself and do unto others what one wants oneself,1
we are free,1
in terms of security there are a lot of cameras in the whole country and even in small villages and usually you don't care about it in public areas because you are not alone on the road and there are no public officials who have nothing to do to look at you but criminals are scared so the cost of crime is very high and most people in their right mind would not choose theft and robbery because they will be caught no,1
you have described the subject of freedom in both countries exactly 100  you are very  love your video,1
you have described the subject of freedom in both countries exactly 100 right,1
yes you said what i wanted to say there has never been real freedom,1
thank you,1
do you care of the freedom in developing countries really no,1
the bed is not  many families in china have the elderly or the sick many more configuration of such a bed because to consider the  for convenience may be set up such a bed mass production of a motor and remote control of the money cost is not high there to go,1
super china,1
so china doesn't have to force people to work on a lot of mechanical helpers,1
i am so proud of my country,1
strong,1
more and more away from the real olympic spirit,1
good sharp  make both money edge degree li really  a world first no one dare to fight,1
better a friend than a slave,1
china is actually pretty   people are going to the wrong place to make their food,1
everyone who has a chinese id card will have a smart bed,1
and huang  and chen big sister expressed very uncomfortable how can overpower my glass heart limelight,1
let not discredit,1
,1
the bed quilt is probably made of  cotton hahaha,1
national strength financial resources japan is not afraid of losses than japan how can distinguish good olympic games,1
it's like a futuristic science fiction world,1
100 metres sprint race at the first modern olympic games athens,1
if the athletes are unhappy with the beijing olympics villages they should compare with the experience of living in  commonwealth games village first,1
wish you all enjoy your stay,1
enjoy the game there boys and girls,1
excellent china,1
beautiful,1
beautiful amazing those countries who ad pose  learn n get ur backyard sorted,1
bbc cnn and other  will be out in force to write negative reports of the winter olympic games in china just you wait,1
wish china winter  to be the greatest winter  for china and the world,1
of course she would say that or else she will be forced to leave china lol,1
those are nice buildings  well done china,1

compete with those who are the best of the world and enjoying all awesome achievements,1
these comments are ridiculously fake and bought by the,1
what if your roommate snore,1
everyone should tell the truth about china since western media only know how lie under the instructions of their government secret agent or ngo,1
very lovely video happy to learn that u love  olympic if u have time u may visit beijing and other cities of china again welcome to  m from hong kong,1
the party house,1
at  lake placid games the olympic village was the future roy brooks regional correctional facility jail  beds were stainless steel with a mattress with a stainless steel toilet and sink in the room  shower was down the hall  there were actual doors that were later converted to jail doors after the games  it is amazing how much better current accommodations are then what we had back in the day,1
thank you very much for the video best wishes to you and your team,1
so cool,1
good good,1
the girls' room is much more tidy than the boys'  refueling i don't know if the end of the winter olympic games can athletes be allowed to go out to  no matter how good the winter olympic village  it is not fun to go out to play better,1
very nice,1
best of luck to you in your  your time in beijing,1
thanks you girls sharing the olympics village this hotel isnt just a room only its like apartment amazing so beautiful hotel,1

enjoy and have fun wish you success in the games,1
wow really nice and looks great,1
wow that is a hotel,1
some muslim countries realize that its not the west who puts muslims in,1

this video is full of prejudice against china and arrogance from nowhere which is totally unacceptable to the chinese  you know anything about china have you ever been to  you know that china has lifted over 600 million people out of poverty from a penniless  you know that china is now the worlds second largest economy at  per  china have developed so much if we hadnt protected human rights so  you know that china has included the protection of human rights in our  people who know best about the human rights situation in china are not you the foreign powers but the chinese themselves,1
long live taiwan hong kong australia  mongolia tibet and all of those  by the   thx and bye,1
i like to see india boycott video,1
boycott made in china  free tibet  hong kong mongols,1
i  those beijing olympics,1
when will people have chance to protest against olympics in india  probably not in a century,1
china is starving its opponents athletes just so they can win,1
these games  should of never been held in china  cuz of the  so why didnt they have it anywhere else they had enough time to have it anywhere else,1
heres the solution get rid of the olympics,1
did you notice no us protests thats because the us chicken neck speaker of the house said keep your mouth shut we did want to upset our friend,1
si bal    si bal,1
china doesnt show the respect which the sportsmen and  deserve china  show respect to the   doesnt deserve respect of the rest of the world usa europe taiwan vietnam india are enough to show china and russia where they belong they should do it,1
la passion de jeanne  1928 carl theodor dreyer had made cultural vaccine for making people kinder and more humane the vaccine is still 100 proved and highly recommended for any level of judges,1
whoever predicted that   would be the official olympic champion after beijing is a genius,1
basically organise for a delay on a minors samples and youre good to go,1
what the americans and western europeans will not come up with to take away the  medals from russian athletes they even go to falsification and substitution of doping samples at the same time western and american athletes use doping and steroids in packs,1
christine brennan thinks that russia should be banned from the next two olympics  summer games and  winter games  she also thinks russia needs to be banned from the next few fs world championships as an extra measure brennan says in her interviews that she believes this evolving scandal may just be the big thing that finally makes the ioc ban russia  russia would need nothing short of catastrophic ban across the board in order to finally stop their sanctioned doping practices,1
i dont really understand why everyone is so mad to be honest the investigation has not been completed yet so it is not known whether  is guilty or not these analyses and legal issues will be dealt with over the next months and only then will we know the truth  should take part in the competition and if she is found guilty the medals will be awarded to other  if she is not guilty then the reward will rightfully remain with her in my opinion it is absurd not to allow  to participate in the olympics when the investigation has not been completed,1
we all know that the other russian skaters are doping can someone tell me why you would dope in skating and what they are doping and using for it i am interested what can you dope that is important in figure skating,1
how did this substance magically fly into her system  best skating quote ever,1
thank you for all the updates you are doing such a fantastic and important job these days we can trust your words  cause they come from an interest and love for the sport so thank you for your hard work,1
it would be great to see a stand of solidarity for clean sport in the ladies event they should each leave a test sample and hair sample in the kiss and cry to show they believe you should be clean to compete,1
her results were clean for the  olympic game and it should be investigation in place why december  testing has brought the results with considerable delay  in any case  is the best and no one can perform better,1
the ioc should hold the team medal ceremony and give the medals to america and japan those athletes should have their moment roc should have to wait till the case is resolved when the case is resolved if  is found guilty then the us and japan can get bumped and canada can get bronze that is the  way to handle this everyone seems to be forgetting that evidence ie positive  not proof it is evidence guilt can only be assigned after a trial,1
it doesn't matter to be able to participate in the olympic games is a great  i hope you break through and create good results later refueling oh,1
be sure to support the athletes who represent them,1
proud of her,1

they wouldve won at 21 13  gotta get 7,1
he did that on purpose cause he know they gone win in da first place,1
congratulations to both teams they should be proud of their accomplishments,1
rigged,1
thank you for releasing this for those who had to work during the superbowl,1
this was a good heart fought game but the refs were completely blind this game they shouldve called offensive pass interference or a face mask call when higgins twisted  face mask all the way when he scored as a defensive guy everyone just loves to cater to the offense especially the nfl defensive players never get credit for anything in the league,1
this is got to be the greatest super bowl in this decade of a happy ending in hollywood congrats to the rams their 1st sb win since 1999,1
the awesome pinnacle game for the new super bowl champion los angeles rams,1
thats so heart breaking for the  they had the ball they had such a great shot the rams front 4 were too deadly at least my 9ers got knocked off by the best team silver lining,1
what a season beat the  9ers and  go rams,1

she shouldve been checked by a dr than getting right up away i am glad she is ok,1

judges should stop the event after something like that,1
figure skating federation needs to think urgently to ban complex support for female mutilations,1
respect so  despite the falls what a course it took you to continue,1
yeah she was out there for a few seconds you can see that by her arms  the performance shouldve ended,1
yikes,1
i wonder if she wasnt well because she had two small problems early on  so sad such a beautiful skater,1

lovely sharing dear,1
always get more fun by reading the comments from   the china haters from india and its us father,1
wow wow cool,1
i think  took the wrong medicine,1
bat soup on the house,1
love the sour comments here from indians im glad my motherland is getting so much attention and obsession from you guys youre free to boycott all you want but the games will happen and there is nothing anyone could do about it,1
the world first,1
crazy to realize china created the virus thus creating the need for   more technology,1
the world needs to boycott the games  we must ban together against the killer dragon,1
cool technology,1
served with a side of   the house,1
winter olympics have been canceled you didnt get the notice,1
forced  the robot work,1
they should have a robotic bat make the delivery,1
jealous indians because of china success,1
replace waiters for robot who agree,1
they are showing us our future,1
completely mad,1
the us had decided that china would not grant visas to their officials and was going to lash out at china but it backfired,1
china's security bigwigs keep a close eye on visitors,1
the world will be divided into two  and china still needs  years to prove itself as a great power,1
western countries political leaders they do not come to why we did not invite them ah countries to participate in the athletes to see with their own eyes is the best  of china's human rights and security status of science and technology level western acid politicians do not come or at home to protect their fragile small heart come to our third world developing countries to see the olympic games,1
i once said that  and  showed their determination to boycott the beijing winter olympics by stopping all the american athletes at the airport in the united  the fact is that these european and american   schemes and plots can not be carried out,1
i wish you  health and good luck,1
olympic committee to impose heavy fines and suspension of us  taking money to disrupt games  and ban us national anthem from being played at olympics under russian rules,1
by the time of the 2008 beijing  the financial crisis in the us and europe had already been brewing for a  when the olympics were  the us  mortgage crisis  the olympic games were over by the end of august and the us financial crisis was out of control,1
west down,1
sima nan may have been influenced by the west and become,1
sima nan teacher and  said that in foreign relations should be tough on the  cross and cold face to thousands of people do not reward the face of western bullying do not say to boycott and  on the bully countries issued  china is not they want to come to want to not come to not come,1
most  you did not say that they have no face and they do not have the courage to come and wish  sima nan and all compatriots a happy spring festival and a prosperous year of the tiger,1
because china has overtaken them,1
welcome  to china  genocide  for new year,1
great,1
boycott the genocide beijing 2022 winter olympics  until the criminal mini mao xi and the  criminal cult regime  killing their own people 2 stop the human organ  stop the human rights violations 4 stop the  genocide free tibet hong kong stop the harassment of taiwan 5 stop the terrorist and  activity 6 stop the hostage diplomacy  7 the many other crimes by the  criminal cult regime mini mao xi and the  must be held accountable for their crimes against humanity including the development and the deliberate spreading of their  virus,1

i can tell you as a chinese american that her statement is all bs the main reason is money she makes so much money in china with all the endorsements  china will worship her if she wins and she wouldnt get as much attention here after the olympic  she has no idea what the consequences are if she didnt win  it makes more sense to represent where you are born or the country that gives you the opportunity,1
flawless mandarin the boys at adv china say thats incorrect and as for 3 gold she got 1 which is i admit a fantastic achievement,1
last time i checked  didnt get mvp his first year in the nba his stats significantly increased which led to present dominance your mistaking talent as a  granted that is how it is define in any dictionary but it is a process to achieve more talent a natural incline to learn and master the craft its a process she would not have received the same opportunity that would make her rise to where she is at today if she would be from china youre mistaking these people and noble and greatly gifted when really  just spent countless hours practicing perfection in their craft,1

i thought the germans had a great power perspective and an independent mind,1

the great german propaganda minister goebbels during world war ii said that a lie repeated a thousand times is the truth and the  genocide was cooked up by a german so called professor,1
a defeated nation after world war i and world war ii is a six in the  either that country or its people,1
germany 2 was originally controlled by the  no  after world war  west germany was occupied by the united states and the european union and east germany was occupied by the soviet union and then men were either killed or arrested and women were dragged to play poker at random,1
not better,1
information to have but who cares what do they think the mainland will continue to be strong is the west always feel that the east can not win they care and helpless will sour words,1

the winter olympic games in china has given the world a demonstration of the rise of a great  the united states would rather celebrate china's success in the early days than do so with dignity and   it is a painful feeling to begin to suppress china at the end of the war,1
praise,1
i was watching the preliminary games of the winter olympics on nbc at  on february 3rd new york  i didn't know that when i introduced  the commentators added all the words that could smear and vilify  then a short time  there was a feature interview with two  a woman from bloomberg news,1

don't make a big deal out of it this kind of welcome and enthusiasm is everywhere every day but too few americans see it and too many foreigners deliberately don't,1
the text is really good,1
every time i go back to the united states immigration officials always say   i am also very  but when  a  come back to  the customs officers are expressionless and  and they are not likely to say any nice words,1
the biggest problem of chinese people is that they like to brag and boast and the biggest crisis of  is that they can't see the crisis and indulge in,1
beijing is opening up a new global view of the  it is a decent simplified chinese and english side by  rather than a narrow old concept of only  this makes the world understand chinese and english convenient and convenient for people,1
the only person who can do this is the narrator of a lot of videos who can't even read from the textbook and who goes on the table and gives sincere advice,1
overseas chinese compatriots are proud of the successful opening ceremony of the winter olympics,1
died not yet ho  fong s with any,1
origin from  and international back to history repeated,1
it was another proud moment for the nation to grow stronger and more proud,1
through the olympic games can be sure that this is the last olympic games in old china will not have in the future even if there is that is to wait until the establishment of the new china after the matter,1
what is democracy  what can democracy  world peace,1
there's more pressure on the next host nation,1
good job and support    bravo to china rise peacefully and be strong      go china go,1

i totally agree with what you are saying i started in  in august 2017 and i bought in i was up 5x by december only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85 during the ensuing 4 year bear market i took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do i wish i had bought more i am in profit for now but i am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from  edwin clifford i have learned from you and other   especially my mentor edwin clifford who taught me how to make trade and increase my  from 2 to 9  that no one really knows what is going to happen and i know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past it is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research,1

rather than thinking that wrong things should be fixed lies are becoming common sense there will be no olympics in china again,1
the protocols are for psychological control,1

the united states and its allies are terrified  they fear that china will overtake the united states,1

rather than thinking that wrong things should be fixed lies are becoming common sense there will be no olympics in china again,1
the protocols are for psychological control,1
videos in nbc related to winter olympic 2022 are hidden does usa become as a mode similar to ussr propaganda,1
well done china,1
this channel must be an evil anglo regime propaganda mouthpiece which is well known for spreading fake news and misinformation about  countries of anglo regime,1
china is stealing korean traditional culture,1
stop the  genocide in china boycott the games in  for the  and the oppressors will soon know what deplorable outcome it will turn out for  those who tempted or burned in fire believing men and women and did not repent torment is prepared in  torment from the burning,1
the united states and its allies are terrified  they fear that china will overtake the united states,1
can you see the video of the opening ceremony of the beijing winter olympics on youtube  what about your american democracy and freedom,1
shame on us  beijing winter olympics for political purposes,1
,1
china stole korean culture the top of the  became shorter and shorter and the present form was completed in the 19th century this is evidence that china stole the clothing culture developed by  traditional clothes are also called the costumes of ethnic minorities in  to  logic the worlds traditional clothing belongs to the united  course there is also the chinese influence however it is korea that independently developed it and made it into its present  is ashamed of its own culture of bald and stealing the culture of neighboring  hands and dancing around in a circle is also  and is a korean culture it is a korean culture that has been registered with  origin is that they hold hands and dance around a fire on the shore to make the number of korean soldiers appear larger than the number of japanese  dance on the brightest full moon day is also because it has to be seen by the japanese   was also  a hat with a long string is also korean culture it is registered in  it is a korean culture that participated in global,1
it was o k  not great,1
no ancient chinese clothing and fewer people,1
waiting with great anticipation,1
concerns and controversies before beijing winter,1
i think it must show the  chinese quote living under the same sky which was created from 2500 years ago and is part of the core principle of chinese culture put that on big screen and banner people performing in un official language that is actually the correct value todays western hypocrisy us chasing for  the equality and social value,1
the legendary zhang yimou,1
i cant wait to watch the opening ceremony,1
im really excited,1
sincerely wish from bottom of my heart beijing winter olympics successful,1
ya nas   mohammed  la  ola  and  kim,1
im the first one,1
the communist party of china wants you to see and don't want to let you see a beautiful dream a ugly reality and it is an irony that beautiful dream is to use  ugly reality as a sacrifice,1
how much are you paid for this propaganda video have you got a seat during the ongoing olympic games,1
i see,1
you kinda look like  stu,1
thank you to this honest foreigner for introducing china sports stadium,1
very proud of the lady who is the ice making system engineer she shows womens capacity to succeed in the areas which are normally dominated by men the ice ribbon building looks fantastic hope i can visit someday when the boarder is open again thanks  for the walk tour,1
got a good laugh out of shoveling all the way around,1
great to learn that it is the only venue newly built for this winter olympic and the other venues are good for sustainable use for  this olympics after appropriate renovations  the opening opening is  clear evidence that china is in the right direction getting more and more aware of environmental protection   the building of ice ribbon and many facilities inside the ice ribbons are the results of the selfless dedication of young designers engineers and workers in china hooray to them,1
thank you for your contributing to this ceremony,1
really china did it,1
that's a shovel,1
shocked by the use of global slaves for the beijing winter  foreign journalists were forced into labor,1
so nice to see him on his rounds and listen to his humour,1
thank you for your fair touch refueling china,1
you  all the way around hahaha,1
anyone else noticed stu can squat,1
foreign reporters reporting news without prejudice,1
at the same time viewing has drop significantly world wide outside the mainland winter olympics has miserably mail the expectation from the organizers and sponsors,1

100 metres sprint race at the first modern olympic games athens,1
hoping beijing winter olympic games will inspire many young chinese people to pick winter sports,1

why can this host nation cheat like that,1
its so obvious the hungarian skater was blocking the chinese skater intentionally  those who think the chinese cheated are likely haters they are blinded,1
ez    2   el  se  se  a  a,1
he was blocked to the sideline by the hand so the chinese either had to go over the sideline or climb over in both cases he was prevented from sprinting at the end,1
from what i see the chinese was pushed back before,1
skaters couldnt even stand on ice before they hired s korean coaches  lol,1
what hungarian did they do regularly on their highways and what chinese did  i am not even   seem to me also that chinese do not realize that we in eu do not too much care who win we want to see nice  from f1 always take and show incident from more angels edit angles,1
lots of open racism here,1
in fact   in the previous game china had to be disqualified because of mario kart skill,1
bs korea cheated in the  world cup and caused byron moreno being  suspended without cheating korea does not know how to compete,1
master of cheat,1
so many chinese,1
are you freaking blind,1
yes what loophole forms for the few against the so called  every loop revealed is a law made to interrogate and punish others we say mob boss have a great,1
organ harvesting is not a sport shame,1
please cut the background music down 50 ruins the presentation it is the same in all of them,1
well done,1
loop holes r  in  us country,1
i feel like hes early beta testing in finding bugs xd,1
thank you so much,1
thank you for recognizing problems,1
good job better safe than sorry like what happened after the  in 2019,1

dear ioc look out the window from the hotel at the end of this presentation what do you see brown barren hillsides with no snow on them next time you pick a location for the winter olympics please make sure to include mountains and snow as part of your requirements,1
its failed before it even started good luck  rules,1
the closed loop was compromise days ago people on the inside have been tested for being infected nice try though i hope you have a plan bits a microscopic virus people putting up a double fence with razor wire on it is not going to keep the virus from infecting people,1
throughout  the united states to china is a major contribution to the small series why so hate the united states is not too ignorant,1
throughout  the united states has made great contributions to  why do you hate the united states so much,1
i'm afraid there is some kind of misunderstanding that china is not insulting the united  they are  the winter olympics but they are not restricting the participation of  this means they respect the athletes and there is peace in the olympic spirit,1
it's even scarier to see china as it is,1
,1
china is eligible to qualify only if it evicts american players,1
no mention of peng,1
i don't know why the class commissary in charge of studies is always popular while the bullies can order without drinking,1
olympics and shameless politics,1
dare,1
virtue is not  and evil will come to an end,1
the us has stopped pretending to be real and put its interests in china first,1
it's a little dark to start with this music and better change it,1
follow the us and you will be dragged into the mire,1
welcome the american clown team to the 2022 beijing winter olympics,1

these two are so unprofessional as commentators and it shows you do not have to be an  about someone you do not like,1
screw these haters her performance was great,1
have a hard neck,1
let her compete everyone should be able to  or treat whatever they need to treat its not an easy sport there are a bunch of health risks sometimes the rules are  for a reason but sometimes we have to take a look at the rules and see if that is priority over someones health i dont have full context but i can tell this is drama and i think everyone should be able to compete no matter what they are on does this give them an unfair competitive advantage you be the judge of that of course they can still have regulations but its not like she was on something bad maybe the substance can  them thats on the person who decides to take it or the persons who requires it,1
good luck young lady but your name will always be associated with doping nothing new for russian athletes,1
why cant  be a ceremony for the real winners and kick her out,1
if a  of a med taken several weeks ago were still producing some kind of advantage wouldnt it still be in her system yet all her tests since then have been clean theres more to this story and judgment should be withheld,1
why   crap at the olympics because the evil japanese forbade her to drink magic pills,1
there is so much hate and angry comments here it breaks my heart people rush to post hurtful words without understanding the bigger picture and why  was allowed to compete and what it means  had a  in her december 25  test all of her other tests before and after that day were clean including her test at the europeans in january 2022 and the olympics in february 2022 in such cases even adult athletes who knowingly took forbidden substance at most get one month suspension  this is exactly what the us runner got when tested positive for a banned substance  1 month suspension if this was the case  suspension would have been over on january 24 and she still would have been allowed to compete at the olympics the lab purposely or accidentally held up the test results for nearly 2 months instead of 10 days blaming it on  and thus violating  right to due process and taking away her opportunity to respond keep in mind that the same lab has successfully processed her and other athletes later tests on time  what if  was banned from competing at,1
she is a disgrace to the sport true olympic athletes ate pure and accept glory or defeat as long as they are pure and unlike you use drugs,1
what matters most is if she is under physicians care for treatment of a heart condition sounds she like could have an   valve  or both or or  with   or  many tall thin teens have these she was so good at figure skating at such a young age its hard to imagine any need to use performance enhancing drugs the meds she was accused of only last hours in our systems they are not like  steroids which last months watch her skate at 5 years old she was amazing even at that young age,1
the american press and sports officials use double standards in the case of the positive doping test of russian figure skater   and similar cases with athletes from the united states this was written in a material for the 3 wire sports portal by american journalist alan  who specializes in covering the olympics in particular he recalled that about six years ago american gymnast kristin  passed a positive doping test in which an extremely low content of a banned  was recorded it was stated that the substance got into her body with tap water which she drank from the tap without  officials then blamed  as they did in the case of   breakdown  the whole system for what happened no  noted recalling that  was not punished in any way and she performed at the oi the journalist also pointed out that since  at least 25  investigations have been identified in the united states after which no punishments were applied to athletes and moreover it was not claimed that the  system is under threat probably for an exceptional  is different,1
this is bad for the sport and the russians really should be disqualified from competing the excuses dont cut it anymore  we have seen this repeated behaviour and the cheating had been going on since the 60s  how many clean athletes were denied medals due to this illegal,1
these two decided to take the american  position on this but that wasnt enough for them they continued to dig the knife in this girls back for what seemed like forever throughout not just her skate but also the  hopefully for the free program these two  will pipe it down and let us enjoy this  simply exquisite skaters performance its interesting to see how the russians respond to weir who adores russian culture and wants to fit in with them so much they should disown him for his cowardly betrayal,1
boooooooo to her i hope shes ok but definitely  she must be booing herself,1

any athlete who doesn't work  especially in the  what does he want in  it depends on whether there are japanese judges like the canadian  how many excuses do you remember when he lost the first time,1
that's the true olympic spirit,1

as for numerous  girls getting along perfectly all the time  never ever going to be a thing i have 8 sisters we are family i love them im sure idols truly love their families more than their members despite their members feeling like family maybe but ive also been so mad at my sisters and felt as if ive hated some of them too lol so if thats a possibility between girls who have grown up together as legit family its definitely going to happen amongst girls who have not grown up together as legit  young catty possibly insecure girls insecure people often act out towards others in order to defend and protect those insecurities what they perceive as their weakness girls who are in the midst of literally figuring out real life girls who have possibly spent their past few years actively competing against others who are may now be their group members girls who have spent the past few years purposely trying to outshine the next trainee girl so imagine that thats what  been doing for years then suddenly  paired up made to live in close and not very private quarters and,1

well haters hating on  can hurt him but maybe he already knew this is going to happen before he posted it he saw it coming well haters are not going to bring them down or something they are  like the  boys they are at the top of the game and so it doesnt matter  lets not give too much attention to these  is internationally famous and some few fans leaving wont make a big difference but it is kind of worrying for  and  because they have just debuted and most of their album sales and fans are from korea and china soo it can cause a little damage to them well,1
some  and some  equally both need therapy fr,1
and  receiving backlash for being proud korean and chinese  is making me feel frustrated to some people,1
im not even going to touch the olympics however i will say we all need to be showing more love and support for each other but you look gorgeous love how you do your makeup and different styles,1
i dont believe the  and  thing because they have so many  together talking and laughing they have the closest friendship in ive too,1
china played dirty,1
this years olympics is a joke,1
that push from the chinese skater was so on purpose there definitely is a big bias,1
hope you can take 5 minutes to write a thank you email to the child who hand painted that small lovely painting for you in your gift bag every athlete receives one directly from one individual child,1

genocide olympics,1
the bizarre beijing olympics are being held there is no beautiful story of the winning player and more rude spectators are reported in articles about the beijing olympics including referee buying biased judgment reporter assault vomiting athletes village food  stadium facilities  ice quality and artificial snow the worlds public opinion is that china should ban international matches for 100 years in the future,1
everything people hate about the vaccine mandates isolation and social distancing is everyday life in china china started this viral nightmare we have no business in china for anything and the business people selling out their morality for dollars should all be locked up,1
we dont watch the beijing  dont want my eyes dirty,1

doping queen,1
i will write this comment everywhere maybe then people will think and they will not take on faith everything that the propaganda media says without  how do americans all so honest who are for honest sports feel about the fact that their athletes drink drugs saying that a doctor prescribed it to them but wait legal or not you drink drugs that make you stronger and you win but wada says its all right its legal is it fair to other athletes who come out already knowing that you took drugs and they wont beat you no its as unfair as doing it covertly but you keep doing it and its no less depressing for your opponents you are talking about honesty and fairness but are you honest yourself after the whole world learned last year that many athletes from the us and other countries are taking drugs that are banned by wada after the sanctions of japan last year  showed a poor result without her drugs refused to continue she proved by this that they helped her to take high places lets take all her medals just like everyone who drinks drugs even if its for,1
doping cheater russian,1
russian athletes are all doping cheats,1
will be able to compete for a second gold,1
vladimir put in official approval for children to be given drugs to enhance their performance child exploitation,1
drugs are not allowed in any sport bc its so unfair its olympics every athletes work so hard to be there  be clean and fair,1
pushing drugs onto russian athletes is approved and even encouraged by the kremlin has been for many years putin is perfectly aware it is going on these young girls have a very short sports career and are burnt out physically and mentally by the time they are 18 they are put under enormous psychological pressure to perform and win  coach already has younger girls ready to replace her it is basically a racket in child exploitation,1
duh  why her medals doesnt stripped off out of her,1
the test was done in last december and sweden failed to test the sample within  by 15th jan she was tested negative before and during the beijing 2022 olympic thats the important test  the despite is about the december sample all athletes takes  killer for injuries but it must be cleared or no sign of drug during  after the competitions which she shows negative  it is the usa that wont settle for 2nd,1
the  tests in beijing games are of greater significance the results should be out by now,1
if doping was a sport russia would win gold every time,1
so putin is now the lapdog of the  never tot this day will come russia a proud nation who will not take any bs from any nation now at the beck  n call of    tot i see  soon n korea kim already basking in the sun with the  missiles launches  they do not have the financial means nor the military capabilities for such a stunt i guess  is taking a page from the israelis militant to use other nations as their proxy never an original idea coming out of  copy n paste their style stealing still their best  wonder singapore government under a useless pm fit right  their political agenda our pm n his administration lackeys to the  not realising what it means after all that happens to hk even the eu nations moving away from the  politics now intermingled to show support for their ally the winter olympics the sport of the elite rich,1
the test sample was collected during  on christmas day but the result was not released until the 8  timed to do damage to her  tactics were used to prevent another athlete sun yang from  in the olympic games,1
the framing of russia by the us and its right arm wada is clear here both in the timing of the disclosure of the positive test result and the media chorus which came after it let it be made clear that  sent   blood sample to sweden for testing on the 25th of december and that the laboratory in sweden had a time limit of 20 days to return the result according to wada regulations why did it take 45 days for the ita to return the result and why did they time the disclosure of the positive test result to coincide with the exact moment of the medal presentation ceremony for maximum media coverage besides two positive test results are needed to confirm a banned substance offence since the test itself has a margin of error in this case we have only one and only a trace was found here we are talking about an expired sample and a frame up and this case should be dismissed immediately as for  doping history you just need to check the annual number of doping cases in russia as compared to other major countries like the us and,1
she could have been sabotage,1

now that the closed loop has been compromised could the  use this to their advantage might they label upcoming medal contenders to be infected thus  them from participating and allowing  athletes to go to the medal podium more often than they should if the chinese team wins more than 13 medals i suggest there be an investigation into how they managed to do that with a full contingent of foreign athletes present,1
i told you there would be a cornucopia of propaganda videos coming out of china in regards to the olympics they would cover subjects from before during and after the olympics  and other propaganda arms will be  us with propaganda and its going to get worse   ceo of a company in new york that is touted to be an interpersonal intelligence advisory has been given hundreds of thousands of dollars by the  to contact and employ a dozen or so  in the us who have hundreds of thousands of viewers a perfect audience for the  to spread their propaganda to the presentations these  are being required to make and for which they are being paid handsomely fall under a few categories 70 must be about  great job of doing the olympics and chinese culture 20 of their presentations must be about good things and cooperation between the us and china on things like climate change and  and china us relationships 10 must be about the great relationship that the chinese consulate have with the us be prepared for an onslaught of these videos from  in the us on,1
how did infected people get inside the loop,1
one week after the olympics have terminated all of the structures put up for the event will begin deteriorating typical tofu construction,1
no olympics since its inception will have lost as much revenue as the winter olympics in beijing 2022 with all of the industry in the area shutting down months before the event in order that there be blue skies from the ever present pollution in beijing is costing the economy a fortune,1
west  is a great nation occupied by notorious,1
china is a native palace of corona,1
the useless channel,1
for those who refuse to watch the olympics games dont worry the games will be unwatchable anyway nbc will broadcast the games in 480p resolution video will use grey filters for all scenery and will use photoshop program to make images grey,1
unfortunately most athletes are so scared of catching another type of china virus and are very concerned about the food safety standards,1
tibet is north,1
duplicate olympics,1
boycott beijing olympics,1
democracy is superior to communism,1
is,1
free   free hong   shanghai is a part of india,1
i watched both sides of media most china media  supported her and most western media just blasted her negatively dont pick one negative comment out of millions of positive comments to make your news,1
well done traitor gets what she deserves,1
well done anyway tho,1
kill man as soon as  boy friend hurt boyfriend touched boyfriend kill man,1
its none of our business why she decided to represent china and she doesnt deserve to be bullied by anyone online its her life and the majority of these  cant even skate so who the hell do you think you all are to say shes not good she just happened to have not been able to do her best on this particular day for whatever reasons but she can skate so you can all shove your negative hateful and harsh comments up your asses i hate  and bullies in general shes a human being who has feelings be kind and supportive instead of being mean and evil with your unkind and abusive words words are powerful and use them wisely to build up others not destroy their confidence how would you feel if i were to call you  and other unkind words,1
im just glad she didnt screw up team usa thats what ya get,1
wait whats the pronunciation,1
ha haaaaaaaa,1
perfect look at the american that just got gold  bad karma and good karma  lol bye bye,1
she will be thrown in prison,1
may we see her performance,1
glad she fell ha ha   karma,1
gave up her citizenship well she needs to stay in her new country i dont want her back,1
theyd better send her to the  camps,1
karma enjoy china dont come back,1
dosent  the other athletes who were treated lie prisoners the  doing the classic deny and distract tactics,1
we can simply ignore the rude comments from the us led world order  the beijing olympics are really the finest winter games ever,1
you cant even see the electrical wires attached to his body,1
guess only good stuff will be on  wont hear any complaints about  course not hope all is good for him for real,1
,1
koreans are being negative because they lost a game i find it hilarious when japan gave korean team a lecture of humility and not to be rude to the host,1
nice to hear too bad none of this type of news is being reported in the american mainstream news media,1
the chinese are promoting sports sportsmanship and shared future for mankind the american government is promoting boycott   sanctions more sanctions creating more lethal weapons sending more weapons and soldiers to other countries etc etc we can see one country is promoting peace  friendship while the other is promoting troubles quarrels and war,1
wonderful interview,1
chinese hospitality,1
watch out this guy gonna be missing when he goes to,1
the great leader ma  will lead  to defeat the communist party and liberate all mankind,1
one of the characteristics of the interview with chinese fucking communists  always brainwashing the interviewee in   da sha bi  wang ba dan,1
sports childhood of sasha  the girl who defeated the juvenile and  categories gravity,1

siempre nos  de  al  que los mexicanos  en todo el mundo si   mundial   con una  a donovan su  hara el,1
ya,1
bravo guy  for me you were the best of all yesterday ahead of the  hello from,1
ah  eight,1
just for the eight little western countries,1
nah korean didnt like it,1
hahaha no more  from some countries that rely on pushing and tripping to win gold,1
camera,1
nah korean didnt like it,1
the south korean team is a highly disciplined little foul unless you're hunting cats and,1
amazing,1
why don't you call the  spain,1
all the players except one country like the cheetah,1
more spy equipment to use on the chinese people,1
great use in catching those ice skate cheat and fouls,1
wow probably cant be used to spy on people surely wouldnt be used to log people for crowd control,1
no foul for korean lol lol lol,1
no  no  little sheba,1
if the judge had been to the  winter  it would be clear that ghosts can behave properly under the supervision of  in a good environment,1
athletes representing a country south korean athletes please respect yourself,1
i still have some korean friends and some korean people who have been in china for a long  i feel very   just do what you want,1
south korea does not have a bit of sports spirit   good  to show that south korean psychology is not normal from the world cup to today's winter olympics south korean athletes  at the cost of intentionally push people bump into people and other foul behavior on the brain to think about it,1
the filthy south korean winter olympics team is the dirtiest team in the world and it's a disgrace that even one of their own would dare to go rogue,1
this is a sport that doesn't have a split track and it's going to happen over and over again but it's going to have to be a split track,1
all the turtles in the big drive showed up,1
in my country now china's national strength really do not know you are stupid or have the heart to manufacture false news you keep reporting false news others will only think our motherland is glass heart our country has the strength as long as to the world with our chinese strength,1
now the south korean presidential election is  we should pay attention to the  faction in south korea,1
south korea's sports world is notorious for its dirty tricks,1
title party,1
obviously the strength is  but must make some small  the result was ridiculed and angry by     britain teammates all the participants have no opinion on the olympic village  but the korean opinion is too much fat  the result was the japanese team caught the bag to steal beef and even more exaggerated swept the table all watermelon and  melon,1
shame on the korean team,1
cong er small country is located in the border area looking up to the chinese  thousand years to modern times by japan's rape and insult colonial subjugation while kou kou defeated and restored to the national extreme inferiority and partial crazy chronic waiting for more do not know when,1
how come your english is very much like american english  you sounds like an american,1
probably the best olympics vlog in the world,1

dont believe that only russia athletes use doping in the international sports competitions other countries never use it,1
from what i read the russian skater was taking a medication for her heart the medication allows the blood to flow easier in ones system therefore its considered to be form enhancing the whole point of this is is that its on the list of drugs athletes are not allowed to take she took the drug she should be disqualified usa wins the gold etc,1
good that china aint first,1
well must be 15 year old so she prob wont be competing,1
concerns and controversies before beijing winter,1
the judge have to be bias to survive,1
im in complete shock not,1
if they can disqualified ski jumpers for wearing the wrong outfit surely they can dq someone for doping the  was team event too by the way,1
nice,1
if this turns out to be true i wouldnt be surprised given their past  continue to abuse the rules but are allowed to compete,1

nice video and good promotional material for the beijing winter olympic,1
brilliant,1
not only explained the change of personal a d professional are not often  do not use hands have d  what the ghost ah professional judges see at a glance speed skating as the race car people into the position you first to crash not  so a point to solve the foul of the wild system for the safety of the left player first don't say liu made two left kicks on the words immediately know disqualification last,1
fan  release secret weapon,1
1000,1
the flying cat system specializes in all kinds of fouls,1
from the front  you can see that liu  was the first one to block when he was near the finish  if seen from the  this movement was  at that  when he was about to sprint to the finish  he was worried and both of them started to shoot,1
it is not surprising that some people even won the gold medal in the olympic games,1
lucky lucky have slow mirror china team come on,1
good is good to see,1
in another women's relay  a korean woman also blocks a runner on her left with her left hand at the finish   you can now watch it on youtube and judge for  the rule is not to prevent other runners from passing this type of runner,1
,1
if it's a  it's not a foul if hungary fouls the first power fouls the second power fouls the second power fouls the third,1
what are the qualifications for the competition,1
i really don't understand where the controversy is the same as the chinese players were judged  is a sore loser,1
amazing  best wish for the success of beijing winter olympic 2022,1
excellent modern facilities  it will be great experience to all users of the transportation systems  thanks to the dedication of  engineers  technicians experts and numerous support teams,1
amazing,1
stay strong,1

this is what makes china great keep it up china,1

what a beauty nice blue n snow flakes design should be top notch operations n logistics by the organising team bravo,1
nice train,1
im not chinese but can see there are full of rubbish people in us politics and news,1
screw the  down with the communist,1
foolish channel not worth my time,1
fuck china communist country,1
west taiwan olympic,1
,1
is american  watch american  press  disgusted  what usa is  about,1
when  us become so shameless i used to respect that country,1
communist  china and the olympics,1
,1
really nancy hmm  remember palestine   remember africa remember afghanistan and remember iraq where are your morals  human right stuffs,1
shameless news,1
its a matter of balance so you need see the other side also the western style bs like the trump style in a beautiful name of free speech that is what is making this world ugly small brains cannot think comprehensively so you need enlarge yours,1
ban china from hosting the olympics in the future,1
damn 101 subs congrats,1
russia no 1,1
the most interesting is what the koreans say do they really think anyone cares about them,1
want to ask the korean woman who criticized these chinese measures can you think of better method which the government can better protect its people from foreigners who may be carrying  obviously she said what she said out of selfishness and  attitude when you can still walk around a large area how is it a prison,1
well done china,1
why do chinese people who have no shame make the olympics difficult and make it difficult for people around the  now on only chinese people will gather and replay sports,1
this news  comments are surely breaking    glass hearts,1
olympic beijing china x us    2019 2020  2022  war off food,1
the last one is a  he said that if he was  he would go to a place like prison,1
whats in that korean ladys head compared with the state korea and the rest of the world for that matter is in right now shes probably in the safest most  place she has ever been,1
as i see it this is a great way for the athletes to spread the word about how well the  are doing,1
chinese in australia are not supporting our government supporting china all the way australian government is a disgrace and purely racist,1
well organized olympics by china  respect  way to go,1
what an amazing system china is probably the only country on the globe who could keep the games so safe,1
all fine and dandy when the camera and the news reporters are there we all know what happens when there is no one around,1
thank you president xi for bringing such good development to our  we will always support you and support you,1
where have you seen this before,1
very happy and moved because i am chinese grateful to the leadership of the communist party of china,1
i watched slow mo play back she pushed the other competitor yet she was the one who crying ironic typical  style,1
2002 korean legend forever,1
cameras made it impossible for crafty south koreans to steal gold medals,1
its hard to see korean  in speed skating not use any dirty moves to win,1
advise koreans not to participate in the next italian winter olympics because italy will avenge you,1
olympics video highlights are more communist and secretive than the   nobody is allowed to show any video highlights because it is under tight communist control of the olympics governing board  even north korea shows more videos openly than the olympics does  what a shame,1
this is korean great korean,1
koreans blaming it on  saying that she affected  and should be disqualified shameless koreans,1
i am very glad korea lose the  im afraid that they would blame this on the judge again,1
womens  gold ned should dis qualify because her left arm was opened to block the korean whose coming on the second,1

china will not be able to take a medal in a match where the referee cannot be bought or the referees influence is small,1

woman chained,1
go china,1
boycott all the sponsors,1
china should have never  been the hosts for the olympics  since we all know of their human rights abuses  and racist views,1
koreans cant believe that china still think korea is small country,1
it is an olympics that is splendid on the outside but rotten on the inside due to  corruption,1

great and awesome only in china,1
this has been amazing to help me sequence my first classes of  i love this,1
the association that organizes the olympic games said it has launched a mobile game,1
king awesome beijing olympic technology is  and great,1
is the representative of china,1
british  his own singer john  in beijing 2022 and what a stupid prime minister british now has,1
ohh golly i cant wait to see the genocide games,1
welcome to the land of genocide and olympic concentration camp  call back your  immediately otherwise they will all suffer from forced labor and from eating the food from,1
concerns and controversies before beijing winter,1
so lets see what happened in,1
china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
yeah sport,1
remember god loves   for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that   in him should not perish but have everlasting  turn your life around and  clock is ticking,1
this,1
despite all this  rhetoric  in the diplomatic boycott of the winter olympics the usa is applying for visas and somehow sending an official delegation to beijing this is a slap in ones own face exposing the politicizing nature of the boycott and hypocrisy of the west what do you think,1
not even going to watch,1
the us has  18  attend the 2022 winter olympics in beijing despite announcing,1
once you set your mind into not purchasing anything from china two things happen you get to see products from other countries and those products are a better quality i keep a record of everything i buy my major purchases this year were an electric toro lawnmower from mexico i only buy clothing now from america malaysia vietnam thailand or india the car parts i bought were made in mexico the lawn care products i bought were from the eu any food products i buy never come from china under any circumstances i purchase food products from korea japan and thailand i buy canadian  as well as australian african french spanish and chilean i will only buy seafood products that are frozen from thailand chile argentina and peru of course im a big fan of grass fed beef from alberta wild caught salmon from the waters of british columbia as well as crab and clams are you getting to see the picture yet there is nothing in my shopping list that has china written on it i check every label and every product i buy to ensure that does not happen the other day i went to buy,1
funny that the  us government thought they were invited,1
it will only fuel anti asian hate,1
crimes against humanity in afghanistan iraq libya and syria are indisputable whereas those against the  in  are just alleged and have yet to be verified also the muslim countries including saudi arabia the  and indonesia and malaysia dont accept these allegations invented by adrian  and the  the us is again  human rights and democracy to invent excuses to go to war with another country this time with china look at your own human rights abuses both abroad and at home before accusing china hypocrites,1
how about julian  and edward  huh feng  personal mistake in having an affair with a married man is not a global issue afterall  a mature 30 year old not a teenager human rights issues in  are all made up lies anyway,1
this is not new and the usa is in the habit of blaming other countries for various reasons while it itself is guilty of similar   asian and black lives matter,1
human right lecturer  of the world us let more than  people die due to   racism gun violence  capitol   divides and rule proxy wars regime  this u preaching to the world hey uncle sam u stopped china from   letting them built their own the more u press the more they rise dont play ur colonial cunning tricks of human right cover to interfere and suppress others rise which u kept on doing   asia on rise  stop dreamt of  them,1
good  they might not want to let you out,1
its almost sad to see that just because  professor  shows enough decency to retain some form of objectivity instantly it makes his  against china so much weaker,1
thank you for this  you are invited anyway like i boycott the nobel prize,1
us diplomats were not  do they boycott an event they were not invited to,1
how can you boycott when you have not been invited,1
how many us citizens actually go to voting booth and the question is who votes most of them are old people poor people housewives educated people are busy with their career then you get a pumpkin head in white house and we go on criticizing all these leaders over a beer after work this is equally true for all the democratic nations china on the other hand has its own democratic system not like one citizen one vote western system but of meritocracy party members are chosen early on based on their academics social skills and hard work after finishing from universities then in order to work for the government these brightest and smartest have to take strictest civil exams voluntarily upon passing they are then recruited to work in important posts again they have to perform year on year in terms of social  to further their civil career this pervades down to everywhere in chinese system it is not a dictatorship or autocracy as western media makes us believes president xi who was elected among the politburo members have to prove by being leader of states before he come up the rank in beijing then again it,1

it's really very good to come around and shave the end of  it's really interesting that even australian athletes are buried,1
western media will never broadcast interviews or smear the chinese government at gunpoint forcing foreign players to speak well,1
the winter olympic games left a great legacy for  now young people love skiing and it will be a growth point of tourism economy in the future,1
announced boycott bj winter olympics several countries sent athletes the most shouting the biggest beautiful country also sent 18 officials to participate in remind those who kneel licking people not only look at what your father said to see the actual action,1
long live the motherland,1
enjoy sports athletes first leading role,1
every time i hear the appreciation and recognition of foreign  i feel very moved,1
thanks for the video,1
china is a great country and thats why us politicians dont like it,1
don't be judgmental from day to day with your own prejudices and hearsay,1
the difference between normal foreigners and westerners,1
the sour wind and acid rain from across the western political spectrum helped the winter olympics succeed,1
it really has to be experienced by foreign athletes to know how well we are doing,1
china has no top,1
anyone who follows today's game will know that the overall level of the players has  the ice is  the surface is good,1
thank you guys for tell the truth to the world enjoy china,1
australian media athletes are saying this under the pressure of communism,1
the olympics should be fair and should keeps its integrity,1
i dont really understand why everyone is so mad to be honest the investigation has not been completed yet so it is not known whether  is guilty or not these analyses and legal issues will be dealt with over the next months and only then will we know the truth  should take part in the competition and if she is found guilty the medals will be awarded to other  if she is not guilty then the reward will rightfully remain with her in my opinion it is absurd not to allow  to participate in the olympics when the investigation has not been completed,1
where there is smoke there is  fire ooh,1
she needs to step down,1
left all emotions on the ice and took the lead in the short program   russian figure skaters are not subject to pressure the olympic games in beijing which our skaters have been dreaming about for the past four years have turned from a holiday into a nightmare,1
what yall mad about  she is skating clean at the games and her new tests are clean whats the issue she came out positive months ago and she would have still made the roc team without the drugs people are acting as if she still have drugs in her system  sorry but she is too far ahead of the rest of the girls she doesnt need drugs to cheat  this is just pure jealousy its a damn heart medication yall acting like its some hardcore drugs,1
what substance can make an ice skater better   is pure te technique,1
yes shes only 15 but she should know better than that  dont you feel ashamed to be part of the competition because i do ioc is punishing the real  because of her wow,1
ask the holy spirit to convict people of the sin of not believing in jesus john  and guide christians into all truth john,1
lol yall calling her cheater but you dont realize she has no competition from outside countries only her domestic rivals she is that good and doesnt need any boosters to win an olympic gold so her doping incident must be accident not intentional btw it was couple months ago now her system is clean you guys do not realize she is the talent born once in a decade,1
o  she is piece of,1
i dont get it so one athlete cheats and less is punished what about all the clean athletes who tried their best for this olympic game the ioc needs to admit that to be fair for every athlete she shouldnt have been qualified they are messing up the olympic games,1
even if she gets disqualified it warms my heart knowing no medals will go to the usa since they perform so bad in womens fs,1
were trying to buy some time until we can figure out a way to award the medal to her on technicality,1
why should other clean athletes be robbed of their olympic experience to accommodate a cheater,1

im shocked what an incredible willpower talent and training,1
he is absolutely amazing super star,1
i will live and  and it will extend to other countries,1
the absolute best performance ive ever seen,1
wow,1
majestic,1
unbelievable,1
cutie im obsessed,1
this is a whole another level of seduction what,1
i see we have a  on ice super star,1
so  and why he doesnt age,1
in my opinion figure skating goat   and  kim,1
wow one thing i admire from athlete is their spirit how hard their training was i dont know but surely there wasnt easy the tears sweat blood everything they put on their effort what a beautiful thing i can see from human,1
lo  es  lo que  es   chico 3,1
this was 8 years  when she was 18 years,1
this is my most favorite programme ever performed by,1
here this you  en,1
one word brilliant,1
piano style shorts look great  but this is my,1
fall in,1
this is absolutely a  drug my response is long but its the medical facts of why,1
russia has still not learnt from its previous state sponsored doping scandals,1
just disgusted no russian can be trusted im finished with the olympics boo her off the ice,1
according to the  athletes under 16 like  have more rights under  rules and typically arent held responsible for taking banned substances the focus of any future investigation will home in on her personal team  coaches doctors  etc   the panel considered that preventing the athlete to compete at the olympic games would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances  director general matthieu   appears to be another chapter in the systematic and pervasive disregard for clean sport by russia us olympic and  committee ceo sarah  said in a  have more rights    the russians will now use this decision in the future for all their athletes under 16,1
and this is one of why i am not watching the olympics along with the despicable  you got the russian cheaters being allowed to  a joke,1
no need to rejoice that she is taking part in the competition 15 years old and doped she will keep this reputation forever  what will happen to her in competition in the future  what do its russian competitors who respect the laws of competition think  that she won the russian championship by cheating  poor child this competition is only the beginning of the problems and for those around him too  only his youth saved him she was not whitewashed allowed to participate and that is the truth and that is what the world will remember,1
russian  at its best nice try putin lackeys,1
someone should tell her that despite her dumb dream that she is still a child not an adult,1
oi oi oi  the people that are talking about her better shut the fuck up unless its good shit cuz i have a knife shes the victim here and shes such a  such a sweetheart people better not fucking forget that,1
everything in  russia is a lie,1
pushing drugs onto russian athletes is approved and even encouraged by the kremlin has been for many years putin is perfectly aware it is going on these young girls have a very short sports career and are burnt out physically and mentally by the time they are 18 they are put under enormous psychological pressure to perform and win  coach already has younger girls ready to replace her it is basically a racket in child exploitation,1
thanks so much,1

hail to the buddha  fie upon the evil spirit,1
jonathan and sandra just  as artists i love it  comments connecting the  scandal to slc were very illuminating fans have been screaming about the corruption in scoring for years and get gaslit by people in the sport when is the sport going to admit theres a  was so happy to see hd skate so well and win a medal you have to just fall in love with their skating whenever they have a  program a few errors but i guess thats part of just going for it the way they did they deserve to be remembered as a great team,1
love the sweater,1
sandra  is an honest woman  and we all need more honest people in our lives,1
i dont know how anybody else feels but i really like the  team and thought they were a little underscored thank you dave jonathan sandra,1
this was a great recap  i really enjoyed such a positive show about a really good dance event i thought it was refreshing to see commentators speak more bluntly i thought scott  was a standout  not only did we get some of those blunt comments that gave us a few chuckles but i also really learned something about how to look at ice dance from his comments about the italians knee bend or the program composition of vicky and nicky and that whacky riverdance section,1
dr  was lurking around at the dance event too no words lol,1
their last minute should have taken them off of the podium love sandra,1
watching sandra watching dave getting all breathy and imitating her i love it,1
i still think chalk and bates had the best free skate by far and should have been on the podium they are undoubtedly the most creative ice dance couple with the most dance ability flow and connection on the ice,1
seeing you both with sandra is the best thing thats happened in the last two days thank you,1
have to think that if the usa presses charges against  or anyone else involved she wouldnt be able to step foot in the us or any country with an   treaty with the us thats a considerable number of countries where competitions could be held,1
my 2 moments in for this event were also sd and pc that zorro program is going to be a guilty pleasure that ill go back and watch over and over again yes its cheesy but im just such a sucker for that for pc i didnt love their fd all season but for some reason in beijing there was a sudden moment of clarity in their fd where everything clicked for me when i need a good cry ill be going back to the pc fd  agreed about the iam skaters each of them are presented in the best way possible drawing on all of their own unique strengths and none of them look like the other teams that in itself is an incredible feat much love and respect for this school in montreal,1
you guys are amazing thank you for giving us some fair but clear words of truth these days,1
jonathan,1
thank you for this dave and jonathan as a long time figure skating fan  the decision to allow  to skate was a huge blow to clean sport and i just feel gutted it was so refreshing to hear  take on the recent events while i heavily considered not watching the womens sp earlier today i ended up watching and not sure why i bothered since i was left feeling angry on how it played out,1
i am glad that all of you are getting profits i mean money from the tragedy of a fifteen years old,1
i miss scott and tessa,1

this is about getting americans to tell good china stories,1
watch a foreigner stories in phillipines,1
these foreign players are the best witnesses to help china speak out,1
japan boasted of its hospitality before the olympics   china talks less and does  at  the games environment and mascots are praised by most people in the world,1
that's  hits,1
the goodness of china is worth,1
amazing  more like a 5 hotel for the athletes  too the haters  look n learn,1
nice,1
all right,1

this report is really great to reflect the different voices of different people in  first of  a normal society should tolerate different  blessing from malaysia,1
but china is going through a crisis i am a chinese from  the current general housing prices in china are ridiculously high there are still many poor people although people live happily the pressure of life is much higher than before many people have traveled for 30 or 40 years in their lives to pay off their mortgages although but people still put the country first in front of the big and the big i really feel incredible for this country that can unite as one,1
the comments and analysis of the guy at   are relatively objective the guys thinking is pretty clear,1
the western media never be   lie lie a lot if you follow the rule they told you to f,1
just check the real elections results those are the  percentage of people of  voices yes we are under mass forces of influence from china in different ways from all kind of medias they have 14 billion of population and taiwan has only 23 million the true fact is taiwan never owned by prc even for one sec there will be only 23 million people have the rights to decide the future of taiwan not china nor other country,1
that older man was stating pure,1
this has changed my mind on taiwan as an american the us media paints taiwanese as more fiercely independent but these people hardly care with the new arms deal the us may as well just send the arms shipments directly to china same difference,1
what these people say is  their destiny is  in the hands of a powerful father  miles  sovereignty and democracy are illusory,1
we might as well starting singing the chinese national anthem,1
no matter how loud the  and  voices are  china does not  china's bottom line is very  it cannot split the country and the biggest beneficiaries of war are western   i hope you should carefully watch and remain skeptical of any western media reports that provoke  relations,1
most were brain washed by the green media,1
are you afraid of lightning,1
good,1
from the beijing winter olympics can identify china's current folk customs,1
the transformers are an american animation and a part of american culture,1
america told their athletes not to bring their cell phones to china because they were afraid that they would  the real situation of china and let their citizens know that the dark side of the american government has been lying and  china,1
this winter beijing games displays the present state of modern china if the west cannot accept the truth then it is no longer arrogance but ignorance let the participants of the games educate their politicians and media on the real china they have seen and experienced after they return to their home countries after the games,1
the communist party's internal and external propaganda that the communist party will not be good until china,1
imagine how stupid british prime minister is he  british most famous singer  john,1
the whole world is  except for east asia,1

a lot of small restaurants do that,1
don't get too excited if robots can make all this  what else can you do instead of worrying about your future job,1
science and technology of china,1
this tells the world that we have robots in china to replace all the slanderous lies about forced labor in  have been destroyed and made a big joke,1

swede pigs,1
i guess it will be 20 medals,1
will watch the most but offcourse cc skiing is the most important as a swede,1
sweden is the best,1
i wish we as a nation had  it but since we didnt i willi love it and will watch all of the winter sports and especially when  national hockey team is playing but not this  think its a disgrace that its even taking place and i do judge every single athlete that agreed to  used to stand for something,1
well so far 1  to sweden,1
i dont care at all there are other things that catches my attention      mer,1
it was great fun watching swede walter  win the moguls i always watch the winter olympics especially figure skating i hope sweden does well,1
i am from the tropical country and never seen experience cold below 15 degrees  dont talk about 0   nor negative degrees my awareness of the winter olympics started when  the 4 hypocrite colonist countries voice their boycott against china winter olympics thanks to them i watch the opening ceremony of beijing 2022 winter olympics it was great now i am looking forward to the coming  events,1
as an international student from china to sweden hope both countries good luck,1
now the technology is more and more developed and the competition is more and more  nordic people do have great talent for ice and snow  come  china is also trying hard,1
sweden is kinda good at the winter olympics,1
even if the ceremony was indeed a toned down version i thoroughly enjoyed it zhang yimou didnt  with little he got he made a spectacular  event focusing not only on china but including everyone on this planet with a broader international theme imagine if this was a full blown ceremony with the talent of zhang yimou it would have been  quality spectacle my compliments zhang yimou thank you for giving us 2 splendid olympic ceremony shows you have  yourself with your artistic creativity,1
british  his own singer john  in beijing 2022 and what a stupid prime minister british now has,1
best olympic opening ceremony ever,1
as the last  olympics that i watched as being 20s i wont forget this moment,1
i didnt even know there were olympics coming up now i know i have to close my ears for a couple of weeks at the  table  sincerely your atypical swede 3,1

i love china,1
chinese cuisine is a world name card,1
china is the best and most  come on,1

the roast duck  are really delicious,1
i want to eat,1
cantonese roast duck is also very good but we don't eat it in a dough wrapper like peking  we eat it with rice and it tastes better than peking duck,1
chinese food is hard to beat in other countries,1
i wish i could eat it,1
wow that's great,1
every time i go to  i leave my luggage and go to eat  for some   are good in beijing,1

none of them said china had conscience for poisoning rats,1
cut the  stick,1
as far as team usa can go,1
big heralded,1
the united states doesn't need a fake olympic games anymore,1
america can't afford to lose,1
other countries judge horses,1
the fear of losing,1
the japanese team was used to the tokyo olympics without spectators so that they wouldn't be  the united states certainly wouldn't understand the quarantine rules during the  after  the american team was not locked in the olympic village during the tokyo olympics but was arranged by ben's son to come and go in and out of a fancy hotel and spread the virus of democracy,1

nationals from the host country should not be appointed to  positions for obvious reasons especially with china and its history of  doping scandals in prior olympics and at the military world games in 2019 because of  propensity for cheating and politicizing any kind of international competition the wisdom of the ioc must be seriously considered and the possible collusion of the management of the ioc and the  because of money should be fully investigated china applies the same standard of ethics in its conduct in these games as it does in respecting  and product designs that it steals from other countries with such zeal,1
wish i could go beijing this year sigh,1

nice madam all the  best which game you are  am indian,1
nice madam,1
eat that healthy food from fukushima and dont regret it your past usa also prepares food for their athletics at least americans  and korean athletics dont have to worry about the food from fukushima because the two governments  their food for their athletics however japanese never mentioned about usa athletics or usa government  hilarious,1
great,1
i want go there,1
japan has officially said theyd provided the foods produced from fukushima where people are banned entering the area and still dangerous due to radioactive  now tokyo olympic village is feeding the nuclear contaminated fukushima food to olympic athletes as a  is not a joke dont get blood cancer you are not a lab testing  please be alert and be very careful about what you eat and drink in japan please ask your team leader to provide radiation detector to check all the food you are  is use of gold medal if you die soon,1
this is the happiest place in the world,1
japan had so much potential to show what it can do but these  virus destroyed everything,1
i think you guys are not allowed to go out side of the village though foods are the most important for you at the moment i want you to enjoy and do the best thank you for  interesting movie,1

i love this song but why don't the subtitles get it right,1
all the other singers are good,1
best vaccine ever made totally worth everything,1
what is the point of showing stills,1
the talent of the russian rocket is admired far beyond the borders of our country  sasha has attracted the attention of world famous people more than once alexandra  is a phenomenal girl whose fame goes far beyond figure skating  even popular musicians and hollywood stars bow before her quadruple jumps and talent  the figure skater who defeated gravity and launched the womens single into space attracts the attention of the most sophisticated public yes and how else  after all she is a personality with a capital letter  a person who follows his own special path in bigtime sports and finds a lively response and support from others in her first adult season alexandra  performed in a free program in the image of the main character of the game of thrones series    sasha reincarnated on ice as the mistress of dragons  the russian rocket which the fans already then tacitly dubbed the queen of  this role fit perfectly  but  still tried to understand as much as possible how and what to skate about so she not only watched several seasons of the series but also read,1
i watched  short program last night there was a split second in the middle of the routing where the camera did a closeup shot of her face and she smiled directly at it while still staying in character as she was  could see how happy she was to be at the olympics and most of all how much she was loving it out on the ice whether she medals or not sasha will still be known as a legend and pioneer in jumping for womens skating,1
sharon stone emma stone as if the mountains cradled her genius nurturing the spark within the crucible until even the furnace fell short unable to contain the flame,1
i feel so bad for  she along with the other two members anna  and   truly revolutionized ladies figure skating but their contributions have been ignored in favor of  i  fully convinced that  had not been offered enhancement drugs prior to the olympics  and even her record breaking performances should be looked upon as suspect,1
lets go sasha she will land that triple axel soon,1
good luck,1
they never give anything to,1
she was great i made some predictions for her,1
the story of sasha  the girl who defeated  film with unique photographs of alexandra,1
she is fantastic love love love,1
you're a  i love,1
this fall got me extremely nervous especially after the 2 hit their short she can no longer afford any fall in the free to win gold,1
good luck beautiful lady  show to them your talent,1
what she  what she  what she's being stoned,1
u can skate clean show the world that u deserve an olympic gold,1
i know its unlikely but can she still claim the gold with a great performance its realistic or only a miracle will need to occur to make that happen,1
please sasha stay clean,1
she lived that program she was frida right in front of our eyes,1
where is singapore,1

a joke by canada boycott the games and come out say get world together,1
155  for your information heated floor is not an advanced tech  in  is a basic housing system more than a  thousand years in korea and of course taking off shoes inside the house makes you keep the house very clean and enjoy the benefit of heated floor lying down on floor,1

just putting this out there hopefully im wrong but sun tzu quote the opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself therefore i believe the  may take the worlds athletes hostage at the winter games its already a fully fenced secure compound in exchange of a peaceful hand over of taiwan or at least allows  to attack taiwan without outside support for taiwan,1

lu  was a frog in a well do you have human rights,1
the  high technology can only be used to entertain foreigners,1
i saw it on a caribbean cruise a few years  why don't you take a picture of the arm's company name,1
isn't that factory technology that's been around for over a decade,1
to be honest china is really good in many places but there are some things where there is no human rights,1
the cost is so much higher than the labor cost that we are still so far away from commercialization which is a long time ago in terms of technology alone,1
even sun  water curtain cave has been copied  but it was taken by the barbarian   the great sage forgot the past and released them,1
,1
do not understand some people abroad is better and more  but the problem is that there are several countries to take out such  the winter olympics is just because of the epidemic situation to minimize the contact between people and people with machines instead of human services athletes did not compare with anyone else to the technology everything acid really fierce also make an olympic games to take out  dazzle ah will mouth cannons,1
the  came to a climax,1
the garbage,1
to china,1
was shocked by our technology,1
take other people's things to win glory for the country and masturbate from hi,1
foreign countries still do not automatically open the lid of the trash can but 20 years ago prepared james webb to go into space,1

this is the most canadian thing ever,1
what on earth is this sport,1
fak,1
this is the weirdest sport in my opinion bit i love it,1
family guy,1
imagine start fighting with one of the athletes and then he start shooting at you,1
just learned about this today mind blown,1
i watched this with my gran got reminded of this by family guy and now i just wonder how this can be a highlight or why its so interesting to watch,1
online lessons who with these paws up,1
any movement players,1
the only winter sport that involves an rifle,1
nordic sniping,1
how i people get into this kind of sports,1
isnt this the guy who comments on the air crash investigation show,1
one step closer to cod in the olympics,1
now  mentioned about her grandfather   how could her grandfather medication contaminated her,1
was the moment,1
i have no desire to watch doped athletes compete against clean athletes  whats the point,1
you guys are hilarious and on point lol,1
if you watch the congratulatory video from  for  win i think evan  advice really hit it spot on and you guys touched on it too on how rare it is for an og medalist to really enjoy such a moment when they are under so much pressure my heart is so full for nathan i hope he keeps skating,1
i too love roman   i have felt that what he needs is a change of venue  he needs i think to skate in a rink where he is not the best skater i dont know what other  he has besides the toe and sal but its his nerves that seen to do him in he needs to build confidence in himself and i dont think he will get that where he is training  i am surprised the canadian federation hasnt suggested something altho maybe they have it is so sad what happened to him i hope skate canada doesnt write him off,1
with  stamina i dont think he would be able to handle team event so it was best he didnt do it also i dont think outcome would be different,1
thanks for this fantastic video i was so excited to see that  was a guest i remember watching him as a child and loving his skating and always feeling that he was  and underappreciated by the way jonathan is actually correct the pronunciation is  and not,1
jonathan nathan cited massimo  working with him since november and addressing the musical details and other nuances  also showing what he was feeling during the skates  see phil  excellent article dated either  or   also very lovely raf supported  work and presence,1
dad had a beautiful  and that wonderful knee bend a high jumper,1
since  collaborated   request and won i wonder if  dad is wondering about his decision to have  abruptly leave,1
second comment on this video  i really enjoyed all skaters i was hoping none would have a mistake all were wonderfull  with their own performances challenges etc i really enjoy it of course was really sad seeing  fighting this hard for his program been alone i really do not agree with brian excuse of  wanted to be alone i  on this it  like i am with you when you win not when you  totally happiness with  uno and yuma skating really happy to see  there on the podium specially  who has  my skating heart since  now would hope to see must of this skaters at worlds please let it happend,1
nathan was the olympic moment we all needed seeing him just be there and enjoy it and the  is so so trained and so talented and he knew he could and would do it  didnt give him the run for his money that was possible but also just realized he would have had it in the bag regardless so proud of him,1
how exciting to see  wasnt expecting that treat,1
thanks for all your great videos i have been spending lots of time watching them all so i call you guys my best buds when i talk to my husband about  and,1
that ramp with the  backdrop looks like a  with beijing   in the background most disgraceful games of all time these beijing games have no honor technology lol everything they have looks like it will be crammed in a walmart returns buggy soon,1
fake snow plowed over a nature preserve great job china,1
great video,1
watching the speed of economic and technological advancement in china explains why west feel so  is so  for good,1
look and no  around that is a nice place indeed,1
beijing is forcing everyone to hand in their electronics  use a burner phone  all the blogs posts  media must hand in their footage n get approval before releasing it  everyone will be tracked  everything will be scrubbed n cleaned up by  government before releasing it to the world espionage at its finest,1
welcome to the genocide prison like bubble 2022 beijing winter olympics fake snow with real genocide,1
fake technologies,1
cant wait to see figure ice skating,1
and meanwhile millions of people are slaves die having their organs harvested so the the  the ioc and nbc can profit  i weep for the chinese citizens,1
i will never understand the sport of curling,1
i drove at some old part of the city in florida the road keeps old brick in some parts it was richest peoples road when it was build it is very rough to drive on and becomes the worst part  even for poor people human life is fundamentally  improved by  new  but not by money chinese new  are great contribution to human society any activities to block any new  are against human society,1
new level of human life is labeled in beijing olympics,1
any new tech is great contribution to human society,1
this is  power,1

im happy to see more chinese involve in winter sports to me the influences of the winter olympics in beijing gets more people into winter sports in china is the biggest success,1
the local resident is a  girl  people are living a happy peaceful  safe life there so they can pursue higher passion in sports,1
a winter olympic games can bring up a huge industry big gain for  economy of course  mass sports are more important,1
has several best quality ski resorts in china hope one day can go skiing there,1
it's good to see that more and more teenagers are enjoying winter sports and playing outdoors instead of tests and homework,1
in 2008 due to beijing hosting the olympics the city got a facelift dilapidated traditional  alley and old neighborhoods were  to their former  were built and many community sports facilities and parks were built as well the quality of life in beijing increased considerably 2022 olympics saw investment going in winter sports industries and ski resorts this would encourage people to be even more active during the cold  will also boost the economy in the long run through sports entertainment industries just think of the many chinese buying winter sports gears and how much demand it would  is why vast majority of chinese loves the olympics and supports hosting them because the government has a strategic long term plan for each olympic and it genuinely benefits the  every country can claim the same the 2004 athens olympics made the debt problem in greece even worse and the venues were abandoned similar problem existed for the rio   you really need a competent government to host the olympics properly,1
chinese discover existence of winter sports in 2022 one thousand years after the fact lol,1
business insider 2022 olympics is gonna cost china 30  expect to earn 50 billion from ice and snow tourism in just 1 winter season,1
china should remove the name  from  official name the majority is han chinese and there are also many  and  people,1
president xi a genius,1
that is seriously cool  pun intended,1
usa january 6th is real americans democracy,1
dont be too happy as soon as the olympics are over the two communist dictators in russia and china will continue their plan to divide up the world and the war will begin russia may start a few days early so stock up on supplies everybody you think im joking,1
awesome lets all go ice skating,1
this video has so many positive  wonder why there are so many haters on the comment section,1
before the winter olympics started id never heard of lisa  or steven bradbury  but channel 7 has shown them on tv nearly every single day since the games has started  starting to get sick of seeing the same thing over and over,1
freedom of speech huh,1
im the 1st,1

bgm makes it look like the  family died,1
i pray for human rights of chinese people no more massacres no more dictators no more tortures no more  no more brainwashing no more cheating lying and  wish peace and love on china with  someday and also freedom on hongkong  tibet and so on long time ago china was great i heard but theres no such country anymore who made china the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now i hope the government born again this time bc i know many good people  save china,1
again 1936 berlin and  do to 2022 beijing,1
hadnt watched much but i did notice three nuclear cooling towers in the background  praying for our athletes  sorry nbc its not a coal field,1
copycat china do you really want gold medal that much seriously do we visit on  winter sports day i already knew that it would be happened also do not claim others cultures are yours china has many cultures itself so why you claim koreas are them i couldnt understand,1
china is proving their low quality themselves across the board foods snow and ice quality and serious  can be good event to let all people know who they are,1
i think its weird to hold the olympics in a socialist communist country its a place for harmony and communication but it opens in a country of closure and control,1
hitlers olympics were applauded too  doesnt mean shit to me anymore,1
and his allies are declared persona non  at the beijing 2022 winter olympics participating countries,1
got to love my fellow americans playing on their phones during a important event geese,1
among all the nations of the world is there any nation that actually likes china who likes china,1
greetings from brazil how sad the world  with a country that  minorities keeping them in slave labor camps and harvesting their organs to serve the local organ transplant market  diplomatic boycott is too little  from every country that even claims to be democratic should have refused to participate in an event funded by the genocidal chinese communist party,1

after winning gold for china eileen gu will take all the medals and money earned from chinese endorsements back to us i bet the thought of being a chinese citizen probably never crosses her mind even for 1 second and shes probably going to marry some famous white american rather than give a thought of marrying a china man,1
she should be allowed to compete as an independent not affiliated with any nation  as it is now this is a joke  she is american and not chinese by citizenship,1
congratulations eileen,1
they give us viruses we give them medals,1
she is so based,1
i agree with her 100 nowadays a lot of people cant think straight anymore which is like eileen says their problem,1
do they know that gu was born in america and her father is white american,1
you are plain dumb to represent an evil despicable country like china  shame on you  you are a disgrace and a trader to the us,1
well done eileen i find the comment about her citizenship interesting as well my understanding is there is no dual citizenship between china and the us yet shes a citizen of both countries as stated in this video how is that possible have things changed or are there case by case exceptions,1
if people dont like me thats their loss eileen gu responds to  she follows her mother dream,1
traitor,1

it's pity,1
the voice of the american emperor,1
you americans are  not   you sent the biggest team in history 200 people,1
boycott is a name that points to the folly of boy such as the  boy,1
it's like you're welcome to come if you don't want to,1
he is indeed a powerful comrade in the war and the bureau,1
i'm in china and i don't know what's going on and they know better than me and the  people around me don't know what's going on,1
its really funny that you dont know anything but you are talking about politics like you are the one who knows best,1
i hope you keep promoting china like this and keep americans thinking like this,1
americans fool others into believing themselves,1
i watched a video and finally realized why the united states called on other countries to boycott the beijing winter  i sent more people to  so i could win more  while calling for  i sent more than 200 sports  the largest delegation ever,1
i really like these videos because it just proves that people can't see through you or look at you in a discriminatory way so that they can let their guard down and appear ignorant isn't that exactly what we chinese people like to see happening thanks to the media that keeps most westerners in the dark,1
nausea,1
the american genocide of indians is well known and deserves to talk about human rights,1
it is  world,1
a group of frogs in a well laughed,1

nice and amazing,1
great to see what  can do for us at this event,1
best game in hockey history,1
i remember watching this live with a few friends in one of their basements while pounding back beers we all jumped around cheering after crosby scored that  goal congrats on 500 tonight sid,1
see in 2022,1
the whole world cheered for canada,1
87 the best,1
whos here in 2022 because of the olympics right now,1
crosby the best,1
its 2022 now a long time has passed this game may be the best olympic hockey game ever nothing can change my mind,1
as an american penguins fan i was sad we lost but at the same time found solace that it was sid who scored the winner,1
lets go canada,1
god i miss pre trudeau canada,1
i think the country peaked at this moment here,1
great game,1
stephen harper is that you,1
at international hockey  games are always epic,1
all of the canadian forwards were centers and i believe all the players were  and assistants what a stacked team the played the perfect tournament cant wait till we get to see crosby and  play together that would be an insane line throw marner on the right  on the left,1
yall notice crosby pretty much almost pulled a signature crosby shot thru four defenders goal at the end,1
good job and support    bravo to china rise peacefully and be strong,1
does the old man have to be scruffy for an interview,1
for gods sake americans please stop spreading rumors the more you  china the more the world sees your  and stupidity you always want to control the world and make everyone follow your rules but look at the gap between the rich and the poor in your own country terrible racism wage wars against other countries at every turn what qualifications do you have to preach,1
fake news as always at least all the athletes will understand from the beijing winter olympic game that their gov and media are feeding people fake news every single day to control their mind and behaviour,1
among the 3 countries of  do you know which country has highest life expectancy which country people can  retire earlier to access pension answer is china in 2020  life expectancy is  years old vs us   us life expectancy dropped 18 years from   and south africa  people in china retire at 55 years old to access pension about 10 years earlier than  us population is about 4 of the world population but us use 29 of the world resource every year the resources consumed by us people per capita is about 7 times more than average person in china but still china people can live longer and retire earlier than people in us it means system in china is more efficient to use natural resource,1
i pray for human rights of chinese people no more massacres no more dictators no more tortures no more  no more brainwashing no more cheating lying and  wish peace and love on china with  someday and also freedom on hongkong  tibet and so on long time ago china was great i heard but theres no such country anymore who made china the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now i hope the government born again this time bc i know many good people  save china,1
f china,1
i think what the chinese are doing is so great concerning where  came from now if they did not doing this everyone will be talking so stop struggling they are trying very hard to keep everyone safe,1
the traitor is a traitor and also a loser,1
the real nazi country now a day is usa the medias are all spreading same lies from their hate,1
shameful report,1
the word americans says a lot  quite cringey in many ways,1
wtf was good news about that wtf,1
why is she reporting work a smile and an upbeat mood fake news doesnt care they are trying to get rich off the,1
lots of  apologists here,1
hahahah spread the thing would be goal more than gold,1
athletes have no business in china maybe now they will understand,1
i hope this shit gets,1
so excited,1
beijing is a beautiful city connecting with other parts of china via fast and comfortable means of transport love to visit it again and again the night in the olympic ground was also a good experience of mine in,1
wow,1
america is preparing to sanction anything about  and anything that could reach 350,1
i imagine the envy of a certain western country his ears turned red  a train traveling 350 km and autonomous with each seat on it being a  connected to  for journalists and others,1
imagine the envy of some western  his ears are  every seat on a   train is a   for journalists and others,1
western media china is using 2022 winter olympics to show off  yeah cry ab it,1
submissive,1
the usa,1
i am waiting for some foreign athletes to comment on their ride on this train we know they rode it,1
athletes from all over the world should cherish and enjoy every day of the beijing winter olympics i believe that in the future no matter whether you are in the summer olympics or winter olympics held in other countries you will definitely not enjoy the treatment in china today not before and never will be,1
amazing train 2022,1
crazy,1
maintain  greatness always and forever  god bless china,1

where is aaron,1
lol twitter cant handle the truth  removed the guys account so much for freedom of speech,1
chinese people should see aaron  as an example of a real american honest fair gracious and generous the us media  the american people with their ideological bias and tarring on  aaron  on the other hand is a credit to the american people,1
shame to cnn  nbc  cbs  wall street journal  new york times  fox news  sydney morning herald and washington post for all of your distasteful journalism  stop putting aaron   into  scrutiny,1
they will be punished when they return home,1
no matter who you are chinese or american the top thing is no lying anymore please face the reality like an adult people,1
honest and gutsy man,1
the genocide olympics broadcast directly from the sight of the tiananmen square massacre beautiful,1
what a fair statement,1
,1
but you wont see the us medias to cover this or they may actually make this different type of,1
of course non of the western medias will report this,1
fix the video description please its being stateside,1
you guys are the most hated persons by cnn  fox news etc etc,1
respect to all athletes for taking the risk of  to compete respect the athletes for their accomplishments without doping unfortunately this interview is highly unlikely going to be seen in the west even if it is broadcasted they will all be labeled and tagged with something like american athletes are forced or brainwashed into saying what they said by chinese authorities using unknown drugs,1

you guys are the most hated persons by cnn  fox news etc etc,1
respect to all athletes for taking the risk of  to compete respect the athletes for their accomplishments without doping unfortunately this interview is highly unlikely going to be seen in the west even if it is broadcasted they will all be labeled and tagged with something like american athletes are forced or brainwashed into saying what they said by chinese authorities using unknown drugs,1
we cannot resolve any of our problems in this country by  other countries period,1
where is aaron,1
lol twitter cant handle the truth  removed the guys account so much for freedom of speech,1
chinese people should see aaron  as an example of a real american honest fair gracious and generous the us media  the american people with their ideological bias and tarring on  aaron  on the other hand is a credit to the american people,1
shame to cnn  nbc  cbs  wall street journal  new york times  fox news  sydney morning herald and washington post for all of your distasteful journalism  stop putting aaron   into  scrutiny,1
they will be punished when they return home,1

for the western  media and the pathetic failed societies of us australia uk and canada the great german poet  wrote he whos failed must steal  tears as he departs,1
there are other nuanced reasons behind eileen gus moral understanding in her decision making to represent china instead of the usa but nobody is really taking about it because its the proverbial giant elephant in the room and those typically   whom lack that empathy will keep acting their part and asking for the wellbeing of peng  and yet ignore and downplay the wellbeing of their own humanity issues and human rights fraud,1

it is a pity that the organizing committee of the olympic games should consider taking the athletes from all countries to visit the  great  otherwise they will compete next to it and can't experience the great wall in person,1

china needs to give her automatic citizenship,1
two faced traitor,1
eileen gu  is still  the us citizen she never been given up her us citizenship according to communist  chinese law dual citizenship  is not acceptable to   the chinese  olympic  team    her nationality  status  must be chinese citizenship  only,1
she is strong girl as she punched back the question even harder when she felt that was insulting and disgraceful the only thing she can not do anything about is the jealousy from people even from the us mainstream medias like she said that it is their lost she got picked all because she represents china,1
for gu  critics and  want to  are you hatred with the american  you know that the united states is an immigrant country immigration is a large part of american society and immigration is one of the important reasons for the vitality development and strength of the united states they were not born and raised in the united states they came from all over the world to build a great  you call them traitors thats ironic  i dont know why the united states becomes more and more confident the us once gave the impression of being confident tolerant and sunny but today it has become sensitive suspicious hateful and full of gloomy negative energy  freedom openness and tolerance are values that the united states has long advocated those who are the key to the success of the united states and today the united states is abandoning them  this is dangerous for a society whose main population structure is  governments and politicians cant do the right  understanding and solidarity will no longer exist  contradictions and differences will intensify and society will fall into internal strife  everything that americas ancestors,1
great answer she has the potential to become the president of the united states,1
sa china traitor,1
investing in  is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth investing remains a priority the  market has plenty of opportunities to earn a decent  with the right skills and proper understanding of how the market works i pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life,1
wow shes quite an artistic athlete,1
mic drop standing ovation,1
impressive  intelligent young  really represents what the olympics is suppose to be about,1
she talks way too american for chinese people to relate to her,1
the chinese people are not used to people speaking english in a western way,1
looks good on you traitor,1
uneducated is a strong word but heck she is 18 and enjoys her gold medal moment,1
what a clown,1
answer the reporters questions having a great time isnt an answer its arrogant and asinine,1

what a wonderful experience i would love to go to a winter olympic games once in my life time any tips on how soon to buy event tickets and how soon should you book a place to stay,1
comment  tu,1
hallo,1
great  makes me wish that i was there instead of watching them at home oh well this was the next best thing as i felt like i got a better feel of the environment there a lot more so than what the tv could deliver now i have to plan to visit the next olympics  cant imagine doing all of that on such little sleep ill have to take a look at your videos when i get the chance,1
great video thanks for the slomo it was great to see it in person through your eyes,1
what does she say at the beginning,1
thank you for sharing your experience with us i had fun watching your,1
love that you did these olympic  i follow quite a lot of korean  but i was disappointed to see that none of them went to see any events glad you could share this experience with us 3,1
thank you for sharing,1
having a down to earth  like you is like having a super generous friend who keeps sharing their experiences happily thank you so much for sharing,1
love your  please do more,1
are you korean,1
i like your videos youre teaching me a lot but i am assuming that you share your family with  good because asia is family,1
nice video which camera do you take,1
just found out your channel amazing  and also you are incredibly beautiful cant wait for your next video,1
drug cheat wins again,1
these olympics are a joke,1
fuck cheaters,1
your a disgrace to the sport a disgrace to the olympics  all you care about is a medal not the way the medal should be  true hard work no matter what country your from,1
and once again the russian make a joke out of the olympics,1
a 15 year old girl is going to do what she is told by the adults in her life  they should be strung up  she should not be allowed to compete and russia should be banned from future olympics until they decide to stop their cheating,1
she shouldnt be allowed to compete period cheaters suck,1
why  when she will get the medal,1
the medication was her is a heart medication and has no performance boost at  your russia phobia and talk about all the usa and canada athletes playing football baseball  hockey using deadly  steroids and freaking dying because of  american and because of your idiocy i hope little  v destroy s the  russian women have dominated figure skating for  and dont need drugs to do it,1
russia just need to get the same drugs americans use that way they wont be detected,1
greenlights olympic doping,1
russia will always be known for doping and  find a way to get away with it typical typical typical,1
she already claims that there was mix up in here grandfathers heart medication so she was kinda aware of it how can a medication be mixed with other meds it doesnt make any sense,1
olympic is no more inspiring people  damn dirty olympic thanks to russia and china,1
russia is always in trouble and  also robbed kim  of the gold medal in  in  and this time it is doping its a disgusting country,1
winter olympics  to being in china now this its over  its not this childs fault but this is beyond white privilege me and my family will no longer support the olympic games,1
athletes of the world except russia it is time to boycott the olympics  the  ruled regarding doping is not fair to all those athletes who prepared themselves to compete and followed the rules shame on the ioc,1
dogs,1
,1
,1
anti china world trend,1
damm ioc,1
the fascist organization,1
what the point of third interview with peng  with thomas bach shes going to lied again again and again,1
ioc,1
if the olympics are to be held in  the whole nation should take to the,1
ioc,1
your mother is dead uni k,1
the olympics are dead,1
its not the olympics its only the chinese games the olympics are below the level with no conscience,1

i hope the next olympics can go completely healthy and now i can have his training,1
i dont know how hard it was for him he was the one who break the records and this performance maybe out from his mind too but he could finish his show and thats the  thing,1
one thing i realized after watching this when failure got you in front of people or when you down and every single eyes on you you have to remember that show must go on and life either no pressed button to stop the time or no rocks to hide you away facing everything in front of you dont run and try to keep you head and heart calm whatever it was life must go on,1

thank you for your affirmation of mainland china,1
japanese visual aesthetic feeling is really quite strong can make an objective analysis,1
lovely,1
tokyo olympic games due to the impact of  delayed the replacement of the chief director must have a major impact on the opening ceremony,1
while some taiwanese dare not face reality and can only rely on inciting hatred to cover up  the japanese show the confidence to face the courage to learn from your lao tzu,1
the news of staff salaries during the tokyo olympic games that cost little had better be able to look at a useless virus detection app cost more than the olympic games input originally east olympic can be better but there are too many unwritten rules that lead to the whole director planning to quit altogether for a batch,1
i hope all politicians should put people first and not destroy world peace and  cooperation for their own gain,1
well done a very nice and clearly high quality clip please keep it up,1
thank you for sharing,1
thank you  for your  in  both the summer and winter olympic games were held in the context of severe obstacles and uncertainties caused by the global  the difficulty can be imagined,1
perhaps what japanese friends do not know is that the cost of the opening ceremony in beijing cannot be compared with that in  under the premise of the same  it is meaningful to compare creativity or there will be no comparison,1
japanese have quality no problem do you know how the chinese scold you in the  japan scold  the japanese scold  the opening ceremony of the east olympic games for the japanese players are not  taiwan is framing  they are not worthy of sympathy,1
beijing winter olympics is a political olympics nothing less   indian and chinese  soldiers  reveal everything about the way of thinking of a nazi dictatorship,1

you can say we chinese can't do anything but the world would laugh if you said we chinese can't cook,1
chinese competition makes water athletes sick,1
it seems that they should be  they must speak the china story well or they will be disqualified,1
since the us team is  it is suggested that the south korean team squat outside the us team room and pick up rice and water and make an authentic wok,1
china is a country of gourmet  it's absolutely impossible to serve guests with   those are the things that won't make it to the table,1
is very healthy and it's a bit of a hassle to make and they can't get used to it,1
a place in south korea defines instant noodles and pickles as state,1
watermelon thieves,1
the korean team should be provided with a large swill bucket for overnight leftovers so that koreans can find the smell of their favorite and most familiar army cooking pot,1
it's normal for food to be high in  at low temperatures,1
it's kind of creepy that  threw the olympic  ice  in the trash,1
koreans still like to eat military  made of colonial swill,1
how do you say i want to learn in japanese,1

purple,1
look very cute and speak softly too,1
the olympics is the biggest gathering of the best athletes in the world haha,1
the agreement was that they would not shave their heads in the first month,1
that was a really good haircut,1
my uncle,1
not every country can host the olympics  china has a very strict  china is very good,1
the head is not shaved in the first month,1
china is freaking,1
norway,1
boy you are daffy  knock off the stupidity,1
norway,1
boy you are daffy  knock off the stupidity,1
good,1
good,1
good,1
very perfectly decision bravo,1
do you think theses world leaders or diplomats care anything about the suffering of people in another country when they dont care for the people suffering in their own countries its all about the money and the athletes dont care either because they themselves have selfish interest,1
boycott china,1
whats the benefit of a  when the whole world sees the oppression of the muslims and christians in china but theres no action from the us or un its a joke they refrain from sending government officials but still send athletes into a country where they so called complain about the treatment of its people,1
so us  by only sending 18,1
wow  not sending diplomats after their contributions 2 years ago  boy that telling china what we think of our gift of  and human rights   really on a roll,1
china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
australia a great country with sky,1
what real dummy think its a great idea to send any of their diplomats and regular citizens to a country that they are also preparing to go to war  it be a great time to invade taiwan during the olympics when there are hundreds if not thousands of athletes in that bubble which is basically a prison in itself so if the world dont allow china to invade taiwan then they can easily hold those people hostage,1
this american can really eat a bowl of noodle  a bowl of  and four hard  this stomach is really big,1
fellow chinese communist,1
korean people do not eat well,1
come on shaun white,1
great to see shaun enjoy his chinese  his final,1
great athletes it's good to see the olympic spirit of  kindness and respect,1
such a class act  we will miss you,1
the hungry,1
a country in your heart,1
it seems that every athlete's room is different,1
the number of gold medals is not  i sincerely hope that chinese people can have more opportunities to experience ice and snow  i hope that chinese mothers will step into developed countries,1
china olympic,1
awesome  good luck to you in the games,1
i think korea is the only country participating in beijing winter olympics this year complains about almost everything as the korean team always did in the past games eg  many others from different countries highly  2022 beijing winter olympics the koreans are just so arrogant and yet they deploy every possible dirty tricks in competition in order to win but this time  is a no no in beijing thanks to those 360 high definition cameras so here koreans go again started to smear beijing winter olympics as usual as a ritual,1
don't snap to the communist party of china  always accelerate the division will accelerate the armoury destruction lie not real people false good kill people to obey the communist party of china acquisition always accelerate the division into that had prepared for the devil and his angels sinus gospel  of eternal fire,1

china is next level nuts,1
oo that is all,1
girl knows she is   goes to china anyways with no buffer time for   when told she needs to  because of policy and because she is   makes sob  voice china  reporter blocks traffic while doing  the most cordial manner to move a few steps away as to not block  not move makes a scene about human  voice china bad,1
great another  channel and video go figure,1
china should be banned from every having an other olympics over there everyone should  the olympics they need to make better choices where they are going to have these fucking things at,1
any updates after hearing the athletes press when they return,1
they are taking hostages,1
dont feel sorry for any of them begging for normalcy and willing to give up your rights and this is what you get it will get worse,1
fuck it just nuke em,1
athletes need to also blame themselves for joining the olympics in china this was expected and people going to foreign countries can never expect to be treated well,1
boycott beijing 2022,1
rats 9,1
genocide olympics,1
british  his own singer john  in beijing 2023 and what a stupid prime minister british now has,1
why isnt that pos joe  in beijing supporting our athletes even putin is there supporting his athletes what a disgrace to the american people,1
zero  strategy  organized and well planned china has done a great excellent job,1
,1
it is delightful to have friends coming from afar,1
we welcome  please respect  when ur welcome to ppl country stop racist on asian hater are so  u dont like it  just shut down ur internet n stay quietly on ur caves,1
welcome to the genocide games,1
winter olympics sports the best good luck australia,1
they are complicit in genocide,1
boycott olympic games in china free the  forever history keeps repeating itself with those concentration camps where people are tortured and killed and nobody does anything about it,1
nbc pulled all of their broadcasters from going over there too dangerous for them yeah but not the athletes,1
if the us boycott the more for the beijing winter olympics 2022 china will be more successful   for example in 2008 the united states  the beijing  olympic games 2008 but the beijing  olympic games 2008 was the most successful olympic games    fact us boycott beijing winter olympics 2022 is a really biggest joke,1
look around and also look at simone  who actually looks like some kind of simon and who is allowed to use strong drugs for medical reasons on this  injustice is everywhere why some people have decided that it is necessary to start with this  girl without even waiting for the end of the investigation and the final verdict of,1
russian bear for the win,1
all the russians didnt die even when unified  armies which ones  got to the  river in november 1942  actually russia without using any drugs became a great power exactly at that  this little scandal because of the negligible amount of  in the urine of a  teenage girl  camilla russia will not even bother,1
she isnt qualified to attend the competition unfairness matters,1
disgusting a liar and a cheat,1
doping queen,1
they should have delivered the result in 20 days after that its invalid it was delivered in 45 days coincidentally in the hot time of russian conflict with ukraine which is hugely discussed in media in the day russia  the wrong country  its figure skating team won gold in team event and  was praised by media for her performance and  there should be no place for politics in sport and  didnt need that drug she was the winner before,1
may you live like the lotus  at ease in the muddy water,1
russia is always in trouble and  also robbed kim  of the gold medal in  in  and this time it is doping its a disgusting country,1
a  in the deal for russia to,1
compete  the coaches,1
when you need 2 month to examine a tube of piss you have no credibility in whatever crap you come up with,1
she doped and knew it  40 days to get results and to washout of the drug  roc knows how to dope and washout their athletes before testing  im sure they all still dope during training  i am sure she is part of it,1
yay lets ruin womens figure skating,1
first   and after figure  best athlete in this  from greece corrupted usa talk about drugs its   many nations killed from  so so,1

the bbc reported that the survey was conducted online between october and november of last  interviewing more than   with an average of about  respondents per  who reported a year of rising international and domestic strife even as the local  economy improved and unemployment was at its highest in a decade,1
taiwan independence is just  we must lead them to the  the communist party is not perfect   she is constantly  herself,1
taiwan is real china,1
well done very  very impressive,1
the naivety of people commenting on here shows me just how stupid and brainwashed society has become  with knowing this we are all doomed in the future  wake the hell up people,1
the west is really displaying its jealousy lack of class and prejudice against china   uk is despicable for portraying the current olympics as communist olympics the west seriously has a problem with anyone dissimilar to themselves and they need to fess up to it and not be closet racists,1
sky news malice was demonstrated crystal clear in this video,1
so proud my government takes everything to insure foreigners wont infect us chinese keep those crazy foreigners in check dont let them escape the fortress,1
sad news station,1
western media love to focus on the negativity of china,1
the us is in disarray now the country is so divided dem vs rep f vs c black vs white etc the government is so desperate and is trying to pull the country together what is better way than to use china as a scapegoat hope to find common enemy make false accusations against china without a shred of evidence well it doesnt work upcoming midterm election will be even more divided more bold  every day we hear people get killed men women white black policemen mass looting everywhere more and more homeless pp  robberies cargo trains robberies more and more pp die in a  street in philadelphia  people outside the us are laughing at this country,1
beijing well done,1
thanks to the chinese for providing the safest guarantee for athletes around the world,1
surge in china means 21 local infections nationwide today but suppose to be 0,1

moved to tears what wonderful children and teachers,1
the american government says these kids are working for the chinese government n they are threats to the us its totally unacceptable so sanction them all immediately then lie to the world that we are going to give these kids freedom and democracy they deserved,1
young and purest joy is wonderful,1
these are a group of admirable pillars of china who are contributing to the rapid development of their country and these children are the future of china and the future belongs to these children,1
success clearly is the concerted effort and dedication of the chinese people themselves  their dedication is unparalleled no wonder their country have reached the status that they are in now,1

olympic village,1
so far i see no problem in vancouver having this incredible olympic experience in 2030 you can even expand that legacy elsewhere in the city you never know it is the people of canada vancouver whistler and richmond who are sure of all of this,1
the emotional impact and community building of having the olympic games in vancouver cant be overstated,1
how did it change vancouver and whistler rise in house prices from chinese investors taking all your land,1
that is one nice podium,1

looking back at the previous world wars and local wars because the united states was far away from the battlefield and more importantly because american companies did not transfer a large number of manufacturing to foreign countries at that time the american economy benefited from the wars  but since a large number of american manufacturing companies have relocated overseas especially since china joined the  and attracted global manufacturing companies including american companies to relocate their factories to china the us economy no longer benefits from the war instead every war and disaster indirectly  it has helped  rapid economic development while the us government owes huge debts  from the war in iraq to the war in afghanistan to the  pandemic china has used this opportunity to rapidly develop its economy and increase its national strength  the gap with the us  is also getting smaller  if there is a war between russia and ukraine this time it is believed that only china and iran will benefit and even  economic strength will surpass that of the united states,1

the sky have eyes will punished all the evils ones  day will arrived,1
south korean athletes can only be exempted from military service with a gold medal so the coach formed a mountain training athletes at the same  the old athletes have been asked to deliberately lose to the new or directly retired,1
lin  name is  he used to be called lin  when he was  now he is called lin  when he joined china,1
it's not like you're pulling your pants down,1
when did this happen,1
the national character of koreans is to do whatever it takes to get what they  shameless behavior is particularly evident in the sports  what is more shameless is that in recent  korean enterprises have invested in southeast asia,1
the world should stop playing all sports in china it's a big country but all they do is a small country and they will die soon i mean everyone will die,1
lol crushed 8 to 0 lol,1
it's  we all tried,1
chinese hopes went up when the nhl withdrew and ended up in the toilet right as they took the ice,1

i think that china is a pr lie factory and the leadership there is very very brutal to their peoples of the same lineage or not  the world knows very well the truth and we are  the china propaganda the chinese common people seem to be communists however the chinese leadership is a totalitarian monarchy dictatorship of the most vicious type china is working on scientific modernization but they are a millennia behind on civility compassion morals ethics and good will take a lesson from  king cyrus the great we did king cyrus said success should always call for showing greater kindness generosity and justice only people lost in darkness treat it as an occasion for greater greed  he also said whenever you can act as a liberator freedom dignity  three together constitute the greatest happiness of humanity if you  all three to your people their love for you will never die,1
,1
communism is the very definition of failure,1
this is the part that  me the  asked a  athlete to bear the torch and light flames at the winter olympics you said it is used to deflect genocide charges if china didnt do so you gonna to say see there is not even a single  athlete representing china in the international sports event or of course all  are spending their time in   for china  it is damn it if you do damn it if you dont  is that what the west says unbiased factual journalism,1
the more you stink the more successful others are the more america fails,1
rather than thinking that wrong things should be fixed lies are becoming common sense there will be no olympics in china again,1
spreading the  all over the  rights abuses against   now  medals from the  thats the china what we know,1
they are trying to show that they are stronger than japan and usa they are not and has always failed just like a little kid feeling that they own everything and  printed money,1

this is what the democrats want for all of us p  will be crapping himself when he hears about this,1
give all peoples of the earth a medal with winter olympic games at the first  olympic games at the first  olympic games at the second  olympic games at the third place,1
keep politics out of sports please,1
i wonder if gourmet curry is available in the olympic village i think it is highly unlikely because there is only one indian skier he is the only proud flag bearer of a population of 14 billions and here we have a country which is big on  and light on performance bitching about the conditions of the olympics when a mere single person made it to the game bones ticking out i have seen plenty of indians who live on the shanty towns many of them are  do look like  starvation with rib bones ticking out,1
but the people must know before what waiting them in that country they should take their own food to china i mean its a very strange country   like cats and dogs are beaten to death for make a meal of them burned alive and such cruel things are there very normal when you travel through the country you will not find any sink in a public toilet so their dont wash their hands   the people spit on the streets without shame you see it everywhere and its only possible to drink water from closed bottles so better dont eat there things that you dont cook by yourself,1

a really unfortunate thing about small town japan is that if you are killing time between  there is often nothing in terms of a coffee shop pub  you take for granted in urban japan,1
i'm waiting for revenge video,1

what time of the year is best to travel here,1
this is so realistic trip this reminds me of my travel,1
just found your channel am in ohio  a faithful viewer has made me start researching japanese geography and history keep the information coming my friend hot chocolate with toasted marshmallows on  favorite winter beverage here in the states not a  if hot  spoon is safer to use,1
i just love the subtitles compelled me to sub and like,1
just a question is it just because of  or just the sheer  of people why most shops are sold out and closed,1
hello q excellent idea to take me to travel x japan fascinates me i love it is a culture i am,1
freedom,1
i don't want to see it because i've put so many ads in  this place is spotty and i'll never see it again,1

china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
i belive there are more people have benefit because of that every place that have big event will effect the price of everything at there,1
just putting this out there hopefully im wrong but sun tzu quote the opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself therefore i believe the  may take the worlds athletes hostage at the winter games its already a fully fenced secure compound in exchange of a peaceful hand over of taiwan or at least allows  to attack taiwan without outside support for taiwan,1
is this the only negative story you can fabricate soon there will be many athletes perhaps you can report about the crowds and the noise from the ceremonies  then you can report about the sparse crowds yes you can fabricate more negative stories if you try harder come on you can get paid by us congress it authorized 3 millions per year for smear stories about china,1

all the chefs are busy cooking food for the chinese athletes,1
food prepared and served with all the dedication passion and heart a robot has to offer,1
india still using their dirty hand to serve the food without glove,1
how  disgusting rewarding them for reckless behaviour,1
i wish they would keep the restaurant after olympics,1
ignore the national media,1
you can find these cooking robots in  shanghai and  in china two years ago in fact they are not new things but very suitable for pandemic periods thats why they got popular again  i personally do not like the taste of chinese food cooked by the robot as chinese cooking procedure is quite complicated but frankly it is already quite similar to that cooked by a real human these robots could be easily used in the  industry like subway even safer than humans,1
isolation is a good way to keep the visitors from seeing the slave labor camps smart move china,1
fast food chains will copy this,1
china origin virulent infectious disease,1

i was in canada so i didn't watch the opening  the reason is that all the western media here are hacking the beijing winter olympics including canadian national  i wanted to watch china central television through  but missed the chance,1
the opening ceremony of the winter olympics in beijing is the most magnificent ceremony  go china,1
paris is under pressure to watch the winter olympics amid quarantine,1
there was also a part where the flags of 56 ethnic groups were sent and i think it was very meaningful to show the harmonious coexistence of various ethnic groups and also the olympic spirit and ideals,1
world in turmoil winter olympics in good times unusual chinese people unusual olympics,1
i envy the chinese in new zealand,1
slightly slow down the effect may be more perfect,1
give a like,1
why can't you see reruns of the opening ceremony anywhere,1
happy new year,1
i like the big snowflake on the opening ceremony of the winter olympic  its ingenious conception and beautiful  this design is gathered with the connotation of the big spring and white  which is so advanced that i see that the french tv station uses the big  every day as the logo of the beijing winter olympic  they make this snowflake more flexible by the way of oblique side and slow rotation,1
dou beauty all these are the opening ceremony i saw but did not have a detailed taste after your sharing in  i think about the feeling is different and a little more profound experience very good very good very good,1
very well  it would be great if people who do not speak chinese could understand your explanation,1
today the beautiful woman looks especially young and feels really healthy and beautiful,1

your life legend is praising your country for playing against a korean player,1
really envy mainland chinese can look down on foreigners white people long live the chinese nation,1
the tears of being force labor port of taiwan independence is all that is false illusion to wheels with onions out tears of the glue is all illusion to you don't frighten my san mao tower green class without my glass heart didn't,1
praise for the chinese athletes reflects the chinese people's mind and friendship to the friendly chinese and american people,1
i love our motherland long live long live our motherland,1
thank you for your kind  let us see the multinational athletes who came to beijing to participate in the winter olympic games happily feel the warm reception given by the chinese olympic  chinese athletes also communicate with each other with sincere friendship and encouragement,1
friendship reunion after winter olympics all participants within five years china tourism entry discount travel to china youtube video global competition all the above are paid in digital  fear the wolf before fear the tiger fear the battle lose the battle to raise troops not to fight generals fear death civil officials greedy for money  of the nation to dispel the whole party's fear of the united states before reunification of taiwan,1

it's great my country,1
predecessors planted a  of love future generations with tears  it grow refueling for the motherland to a higher level,1
chinese people are always too generous foreigners are always mean when you get home it's a big deal to get a small one as a compliment please compliment us in society we should also put it on our lips even if the police enforce the law we should be polite to our attitude we should pay attention to our tone of voice so as not to cause  attitude affect prestige cause in our hearts,1
come on china,1

i couldn't help crying when i heard  i love my native  china,1
i hope those people who are fooled by the political stick and media will come and see the real  please remember that an old chinese saying says that the wrong people are the wrong  all the wrongdoings committed by the countries headed by the us emperor are on china's head,1
a chinese from  was deeply moved,1
nice propaganda gt   keep up your hard work,1
there are  different dishes at the beijing winter olympics covering all different  from the world 24 hour serve  the food is all free its just amazing,1
btw koreans are complaining that olympic  village foods are lack of variety and taste and they took all water melons,1
ones  preference for food is very subjective it makes it more tricky when politics yes politics in food becomes entangled in it as per usual some  youtube sites gave some athletes from certain countries the microphone to lodge complaints about the quality of food being served according to an indian site the food is so poor that the athletes are suffering from malnutrition and their bones are sticking out from starvation i believe that especially from india but there are a few dodgy sites with known history of  propaganda also wheeled out a select few to bitch and moan about everything from the surveillance the security  measures the size of their room poor hygiene and of course the food not being to their  reminds me of a friend i used to work with while he was a a school in a third world country why was he living in a 3rd world country when he belonged to the developed world his father was in the air force of the british empire and that country was one of the colonies he told me about the wonders of the street foods walking home from school he,1
it's a website that praises china and invites you to visit t,1
i am an us citizen thats born in china i use chinese social medias and are into chinese cultures i got really  off when i saw the news commenting about how theres not enough food for the athletes this video made me feel a lot better at least the athletes are telling the truth i am glad that the athletes are enjoying the chinese foods competition second friendship first,1
bbc free food and drinks a ploy by beijing to make foreign athletes put on weight,1
funny how some korean athletes were being hypercritical about our food while sneaking food into their rooms to secretly consume them,1
yea but you cant get that good food if they quarantine you and then they feed you meals that look like they were rejected from a united states prison or school,1
western medias again lied about china of giving bad  western  never know they get fooled everyday by their medias,1
amazing foods,1
let not those who disbelieve think they will escape indeed they will not cause failure to allah and prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of  of war by which you may terrify the enemy of allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know but whom allah knows and whatever you spend in the cause of allah will be fully repaid to you and you will not be wronged quran,1
i admire you for eating like that,1
i was dining in a   in paris and was pleasantly surprised to see duck wrapped and cooke,1
hey   the guys in this video are actors and they are all paid by the china government because the korean players said they just wanted to go home after seeing the menu in olympic canteen,1
red bean bun is my favourite too since i was a kid,1
shows our chinese hospitality,1

chapter  on the 4th day of the  the netherlands is still at  the winter olympic games begin in spring,1
omg did the  propaganda ever pulled one over on the people watching the  even anyone is when you watch the  going down the ski jump and doing their  you dont get to see about 100 yards away the cooling towers and the sky high  and the huge boilers oh yeah i almost forgot theres also the sprinkling of fake snow on the jump ramp the ski jump is built in the middle of a defunct factory zone in beijing its a godawful site please ioc next time you award the winter olympics to a country please ensure they have mountains and snow and proper facilities for the events and for the athletes ps a water pipe broke in the brand new olympic athletes quarters sending  of water from the upper floors through to the bottom through the walls and light fixtures and electrical  athletes are getting to see firsthand chinese tofu construction,1
great,1
the trill of victory the  of defeat,1
noone should be watching this  olympics it is shamefull how they treat their own citizens,1
nobody cares about the genocide olympics,1
investing in  now should be in every wise individuals list in some months time  be ecstatic with the decision you made today,1
oh very good,1
judges took the leading teams out of the equation therefore it was easier to reach the podium,1
stocks are crashing  investment right now will be at every wise individuals list  in a month you will be ecstatic with the decision you made today,1
im canadian we watched this in class they fly like a bird,1
great to see the left praising a nation that actively practices genocide against a portion of its population  but then again the canadian political left would love to do to conservatives what china does to the,1
very important,1
three cheers for canadian  many many many more  on where the games are held though so sad,1
first canadian  medal in ski  story,1
so we have mandates and restrictions here in canada but we can send our athletes to china where this virus started  the same  country where they have camps for muslims  canada is a joke and supports concentration camps,1
boycott the genocide beijing 2022 winter olympics  until the criminal mini mao xi and the  criminal cult regime  killing their own people 2 stop the human organ  stop the human rights violations 4 stop the  genocide free tibet hong kong stop the harassment of taiwan 5 stop the terrorist and  activity 6 stop the hostage diplomacy  7 the many other crimes by the  criminal cult regime mini mao xi and the  must be held accountable for their crimes against humanity including the development and the deliberate spreading of their  virus,1

china and  or any country that is on the cross hairs of the us will be subjected to their massive twisted  such  of mass destruction  to invade iraq weapons of mass  to invade afghanistan weapons of mass distractions  to escalate the war tensions in ukraine weapons of mass lies  to slander  handling of beijing winter    taliban terrorists,1

i am from the southern part of india i was very amazed to know that a chinese woman   who led the first leg of the torch rally at the age of 80 won the winter champion title in 1963 she is truly a role model for all women not only in china but in the whole asia if india wins more than five medals in the summer olympics that is really a great achievement forget about winter  a  ice cream eating is a winter olympic sport india might win a silver medal beaten by pakistan by a huge margin,1
shame of asia,1
int,1

most lame torch lighting in the history of the olympics i think they forgot the actual torch versus the lighter,1
wheres all the people its so pathetic to see empty stadiums and everything looks so clinical and sterile,1

everyone has a strong opinion about this case yet they dont have the facts and the details about it there must be a valid reason why she was allowed to compete i find it suspicious that the sample was taken in december of the previous year and the results were only reported just before the team event she is a minor and the officials should be more responsible in handling this case i am also suspicious of those who will directly benefit if this case goes out of hand some athletes and news agencies in a particular country are exaggerating their reports and trying to insinuate something that puts immense pressure on this young athlete shameful and irresponsible,1
drug cheat  wins again what about the clean athletes what you expect from russia,1
why the hell is she still competing she should  be banned what about  richardson who only took marijuana and got  is pure injustice,1
she just competing just now she is in first place so far she shouldnt get a   if she has a heart condition she should take care of herself,1
the drug is also administered for  this aside it is very unprofessional to have a smug smile during professional commentary plus the guy is right  we are not  what happened to the cleaning lady who broke the american team probes by mistake in rio,1
it is not first time russian involves this kind of  take this game very personal they could do everything to  get the gold she is talented  yes but she could get a little bit help with these medications also,1
russia shouldnt even be allowed in the olympics until the ban is lifted that means no roc,1
its ridiculous how everybody just assumes that  was actually taking that medication and than pour their hate based on the assumption we just dont know enough details for now  it couldve been an accident some traces of that chemical in another product she couldve  out of an unwashed glass after her grandparent taking medication and so  do know for a fact that she tested negative just 2 weeks after winning the european championship and later at the  its funny that everybody calls doping a banned but a pretty useless for skaters  guys lets go easier on the little girl untill it is proven that she actually doped which is not for the moment  honestly i doubt will be proven because that kind of doping scenario for such athlete whos in another league from the rest of the world  its just surreal full scale hate campaign and bullying that 15 yo girl by grownups is real though and quite disgusting,1
tbh russia should be permanently banned for the fact they didnt learn to stop doping,1
no americans europeans has ever been caught for doping  yet americans has always won most amount of medals,1
but i bet no one wants to talk about heart issues to an elite athlete who was forced to take a,1
olympics stopped being olympics its all political and people all of a sudden found doping after the ukraine vs putin disaster,1
i wholeheartedly agree that there shouldnt be unfair advantages given to certain athletes  thats why it makes me so happy your network will be paying for every single athlete to be able to train in a world class facility with the best equipment coaching staff training staff medical etc  awesome of you,1
russia has still not learnt from its previous state sponsored doping scandals,1
full disclosure i believe  is innocent she is young and has a rising career ahead of us no need to take unnecessary risks and ruin her career she is already dominating the field now and can only get better in 4 years however the argument that  is too good she doesnt need it is not valid  this is like saying lance armstrong cannot be doping because he is the world champion  the flipside could be true that using performance enhanced drugs helped him maintain his winning im pointing this out only because such an argument is logically unsound and can alienate those in the middle group away from,1

what have your thoughts been on the 2022 us olympic figure skating team,1
i dont want to know about ice skaters sex lives  i want to see them ice skate,1
love nathan chen gracious poised  and a groundbreaking skater  so happy he won the gold    i dont care about the gender identity thing,1
this  thing is getting a bit boring they come across as history detached drama queens who crave attention 1976 british figure skater openly came out before winning the world and olympic gold even before this many public figures sports people actors and musician had made it known they were gay in 2022 in the western hemisphere this isnt a big deal and even legal issues arent so much discrimination as much as anomalies in the mass of laws we live under they seem to enjoy drawing attention to themselves so they can complain about the attention i and millions of others dont live our lives in the belief that all we have to offer is our sexuality,1
hahahaha a male figure skater really need to open up about his sexuality isnt it obvious,1
wtf is that,1
yes what does it matter thank you nbc for coming out now how about same sex,1
i dont care about others sexual preferences,1
hell world,1

a regime based on forced labor and mass enslavement a regime that prepares for war and exists only through lying propaganda how can such a regime respect peaceful sports and free sportsmen believe me those of the international sportsmen who go to berlin will be there nothing but gladiators prisoners and  of a dictator who already feels himself master of this world heinrich mann conference in defense of the olympic idea june 6 and 7 1936 paris,1

slovak miracle on ice,1
these demented transmissions,1
soulless disney victim,1
outstanding effort by the czech team one of the best exciting games in olympic history  a gold medal level,1
,1
hi from  game,1
thanks for the stream man,1
wow look at all the snow,1
china plus and the amazing  operator for this amazing look in the olympic village,1
al je videos,1
actually using artificial snow is essential and just norm for winter olympics not a new thing but now become a wrong doing for beijing also the cooler tower behind the stage is not a nuclear plant  but just a steel mill closed 10 years ago and transformed into a leisure and cultural area,1
beautiful,1
job well done happy chinese new year of the tiger,1
thank you for making responsible video i never seen before because i see you going around beijing nearly all over im chinese at south africa now i very enjoy looking this video you bring a lots for me thank you so much,1
is beijing getting snow because for the first time of less pollution,1
not fake snow its not natural snow,1
you dont seem to be aware that 95 or more of humanity will never be able to watch the olympics except on tv if we are lucky  or not  winter or summer alike,1
nice people presents a nice video very elegant voice and manner very charming,1
hello from new york  yes i am watching the olympics  its the personal stories i am interested in not country rivalries,1
why the weston medias are always so mean and trivial beijing winter olympic is still the most successful winter sport event historically even without real snow who cares the snow is real or manmade as long as the athletes enjoy and feel safe and comfortable keep in mind even a powerful country like china is not able control the weather,1
god bless china,1
because the chinese team also participated in a lot of speed skating i watched a lot of dutch speed skating competition the dutch team is really powerful and check the dutch team 70 of the athletes are participating in speed skating all the medals are are from this project in addition to the dutch team there are not many european countries especially the strong nordic countries almost no it seems that the netherlands  has monopolized the project in  suzanne  is too strong,1
nice,1
living in china to    of all places in the world  climbing  with  is illegal there you know that do you fake snow is true competing on fake snow hurts the athletes is also true,1
this looks like  park where i live right next to haha good video,1
haters  complain more and more is coming true,1
pretty pretty thanks for this video,1
too much negative news about the olympics here in canada i think sports and politics should be mutually exclusive ancient greeks would stop conflicts to host the games here we are in the 21st century and mixing sports and politics together what a shame  love from canada,1
zhang yimou is a gem his direction of beijing olympics 2008 opening ceremony will forever remain a masterpiece,1
you already have a plan for  for it,1
does anyone give a hit about the chinese olympics i dont,1
he is the best director in china love to watch his,1
spoken with a heart for  wealth joys peace,1
im touched with how chinese people opened this meaningful winter olympics in the time of pandemic downsizing of olympic flame began during rio  in response to a more  events and china made it better more captivated by singing choirs of children around the cauldron and the  cards of participating countries this is a remarkable and endearing one what a great show  greetings from manila,1
and i saw the video its also inspired by the first olympic flame lighting moment that was really simple back in the day,1
my profound respect to you mr zhang yimou your team and all people participating in such a simple creation but how strength is the meaning its a powerful imagination,1
and his allies are declared persona non  at the beijing 2022 winter olympics participating countries,1
its brilliant and absolutely beautiful great job mr zhang,1
chinese romance,1
,1
it's so  it's so good to say sham of you to america compared to its narrow political thinking,1
hello is anybody really paying any attention to this nonsense by a desperate dictatorship to gain recognition and respect,1
simple and yet awesome,1
shame on the chinese government imitate steal copy from technology now they steal korean culture,1
inspiring and creative,1
who cares she is the best everyone does drugs,1
she has 2 other drugs that are also performance enhancing come on olympics get your shit together,1
beijing olympics is the most crooked olympics ever in history china getting gold by cheating the system buying judges and giving false penalties so china could advance to semi or final disgusting,1
ban her from the olympics period this is disgusting ioc should uphold integrity and rules of the olympics but they are so crooked now,1
she has the ability to win a medal without doping but she doped and her efforts were disparaged even if she does well in the future the world will see her as a liar its a sin she should receive for other participating players,1
when does first surfaced about her violation i told everyone guarantee you  let her compete  its all about money they will lose millions of viewers and  dollars if they dont let her compete  deal with it after the olympics everythings corrupt the media the democrats the government they nfl wake up its all about the money,1
wheres  harding when you need her,1
doping queen  i love you,1
so they didnt hold the metal ceremony because of the  who allegedly took drugs why are they holding up everyones medal for this white russian girl who apparently gets a pass to have drugs and her blood system now  using the excuse of her grandfathers medication this is a lie,1
i will write this comment everywhere maybe then people will think and they will not take on faith everything that the propaganda media says without  how do americans all so honest who are for honest sports feel about the fact that their athletes drink drugs saying that a doctor prescribed it to them but wait legal or not you drink drugs that make you stronger and you win but wada says its all right its legal is it fair to other athletes who come out already knowing that you took drugs and they wont beat you no its as unfair as doing it covertly but you keep doing it and its no less depressing for your opponents you are talking about honesty and fairness but are you honest yourself after the whole world learned last year that many athletes from the us and other countries are taking drugs that are banned by wada after the sanctions of japan last year  showed a poor result without her drugs refused to continue she proved by this that they helped her to take high places lets take all her medals just like everyone who drinks drugs even if its for,1
whats her name richardson the track runner who was booted because of  how do  get a free pass for a performance enhancing drug and richardson got booted for a drug that was legal in her home state is was  for decades claiming that drugs including marijuana can so call once said fry your brain the committee  up big on this decision it hasnt even been a year since richardson got booted did they think this was forgotten,1
cheater skater should not win but cheater  did,1
recall sergei  who won 2 olympics and died due to a heart attack when wearing skates at the age of 28 about a quarter of   happen without specific  symptoms while therapeutic use of prohibited substances is possible  why is disease prevention forbidden i dont say that the prohibition was intentionally violated  i say that the prohibition to prevent severe diseases is unethical each organism is unique and may need personalized  to disease prevention and treatment,1
yes she can compete but no medals,1
my dream,1
i wanna try that,1

thanks a lot the best winter olympic games were here nature and landscape are almost the same as we have in the russian north in,1
nancy kerrigan is a champ kudos to her after being brutally assaulted,1
that my mother stood in the top of the black ring as one of the persons forming it,1
singing,1
this actually makes me cry when i think of how things are now and look at this from the past it makes me cry,1
best olympic ever,1
there was something so inspirational and beautiful about these ceremonies from the past,1
1994,1
olympics in  1994 make me proud to be norwegian  i only hope we can host a new olympics in norway  one beautiful winter day,1
1994 was a great year in so many ways these games being part of,1
001 welcome to  ice derby visual,1
brazilian greeting from brazil  94 winter,1
what is this what a disgrace,1
still mad  were robbed of gold due to the politics in ice dance at the time,1
the games itself is opened at 12 february 1994  the day when i born,1
im born at 1994  at that time i was a baby  now im 27 this year oh gosh  time flies so fast,1
i did find it odd that   when she won of the 9 judges there were 4 from democratic governments 4 from former communist governments and china the 5 communist judges all put  ahead of kerrigan the german judge was a former east german skater and hardcore communist supporter,1
are there documentaries this perfect for all of the olympics the stories arent politically motivated  personal and have you rooting for the champions and the  no matter your personal biases again perfect 3,1
greatest olympic games ever,1
the second appeal of the citizens of russia to the citizens of the united states of  citizens of the united states of america  we the citizens of great russia are appealing to you with our request to stop your politicians from  destroying our common world it is not we who have come to you it is you who have come to our home from the land which is many thousands of miles  away we the people of russia want the armed forces of the united states of america and the  nato military forces to leave the territory of the former ussr in order to prevent the mutual destruction of our world  we are not interested in a nuclear war but we will use any means necessary to defend and liberate our homeland ussr and the countries of the former warsaw pact as we have done many times in our  leave soon or things will be different  we hate an idea to strike the nevada nuclear test site with the intercontinental nuclear missile to convince you even more how serious are our intentions  dont make us to do it please be,1
clearly the rest of the world is with  this beautiful  go cry about it  anglo,1
meanwhile american  call    pretty bad   having a wonderful  one of the best game ever,1
although a few west countries boycott beijing olympic china gave a positive and peaceful images to china it doesnt need to audition the west opinion so how one feels is up to how media interpret it personally it is much better than shit show media and us government us society is so negative people seem hate each other and neighbor  protest and culture wars happen everywhere and near daily honestly i dont know why americans think themselves exceptional is this a true democratic society or just in the name only  in true democratic northern european countries people there are happy and love their governments us,1
i think that china is a pr lie factory and the leadership there is very very brutal to their peoples of the same lineage or not  the world knows very well the truth and we are  the china propaganda the chinese common people seem to be communists however the chinese leadership is a totalitarian monarchy dictatorship of the most vicious type china is working on scientific modernization but they are a millennia behind on civility compassion morals ethics and good will take a lesson from  king cyrus the great we did king cyrus said success should always call for showing greater kindness generosity and justice only people lost in darkness treat it as an occasion for greater greed  he also said whenever you can act as a liberator freedom dignity  three together constitute the greatest happiness of humanity if you  all three to your people their love for you will never die,1
the most stupidest thing is to create political noise on  olympic game to attack other countries olympic game should be sports only this is respecting  hard training even with risk of injury this political noise is not doing anything but distracting peoples attention enjoying athletes performance it is against athletes human right,1
i pray for human rights of chinese people no more massacres no more dictators no more tortures no more  no more brainwashing no more cheating lying and  wish peace and love on china with  someday and also freedom on hongkong  tibet and so on long time ago china was great i heard but theres no such country anymore who made china the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now i hope the government born again this time bc i know many good people  save china,1
of course china knew because western media including time under the  of the us has gone nuts to the point of psychosis while accusations of  human rights violations are put on a loop western media sees nothing wrong with the us robbing afghanistan of its money as its people are facing famine,1
the epoch times is probably the single largest source of  propaganda in north america it is not journalism as identified for a democratic society  it is funded by wealthy american and taiwanese who long for the days of dictator chiang kai shek  it mongers in hate and is a master of manipulation and distortion  otherwise i have no strong opinions and would recommend it for lining your garbage disposal,1
taiwan must return to china just like ukraine must return to russia austria to germany a child that went astray must and will return to the mother,1
chinese bots everywhere,1
free hong kong and stop murdering,1
western,1

,1
this 2022 olympic is full of  quality and,1
where is the snow,1
excellent  olympic village   please let more people in the world to know this,1
china delivers again unlike third world,1
whatever china does does epic we all know that beijing winter olympics will be as great as the beijing summer olympics 2008 praise to china,1
nice set up congratulations and hoping for a successful games,1
cheer,1
wow very   hater will b more envy n jealous to see this magnificient olympic village,1
nice  the best and success,1
nice  escalators have not cover from  many  live videos dont have many viewers  videos often are shaky making viewers headache,1
wish china the best success go  hysterical attacks of the west on china show that china is doing too right and too well they have always hoped to destroy this most charming eastern civilization china needs to be more confident in walking its own path to realizing its dream of common prosperity and a community with a shared future for mankind dont be distracted or discouraged by the west president xi is such a graceful and charming person however the west put the most negative spin on describing him as they always do when they talk anything about china why cannot china get the truth out to the mass in the  i have observed that  has failed so far in telling chinese stories to the western audience they have tried very hard to appeal to or please them but forget about what their founding mission is all about this is why so many individual social media content creators  as they believe that they have to take it into their own hands in telling the real china to the world it is because they love china and they know that the west lies about china on,1
cant wait,1
hope china would have a successful winter olympics,1
beautiful,1
you speak about the   and why the world is in a chineese   will be an humiliation for xi,1
handle card no,1
go away with love and hope to return to chinese hospitality,1
don't give a  and you will be branded by the regime,1
i believe there's also the ceiling of the room the spa videos that were forcibly deleted and secrets that can't be told,1
so easy,1
passion can be communicated through body language,1
i saw it very  i hope it will be a good memory,1
me comparing between  olympics and beijing olympics in 2022,1
short sleeves,1
nice  cool vlog about the  winter olympics two years ago glad that you enjoyed south korea i took a 12 hour layover tour in seoul before continuing my journey to san francisco california i love the food  culture,1
winter olympics   i was watching the winter olympics specifically the mens figure skating like a damn hawk i was infront of my tv for the sp and holding my phone for the fs i was practically screaming when  won,1
i died at ok,1
lol my obsession for tessa and scott brought me  found your philippine  definitely subscribed,1
hi ate lauren im very fan of you as a pageant boy  you see this    is one of my dr,1
what a cool experience 3,1
diplomatic and foreign affairs bureaucracy has much to learn from this 18year old besides her superb choice of words she had the right tone and hit hard with a smile  ignoring certain questions while using the occasion to make points she wanted to make very talented the foreign affairs  stern and dry answers using terms that are not well understood outside china are not effective in influencing world views at least an alternative lighthearted but effective approach should be tried it is not too late to learn because the information war will go on for decades,1
eileen gu will never be able to return to the united states because she gave xi  a propaganda victory over america  she wont be competing in athletics in america  gu is like many chinese in america  a threat and disappointment,1
talented and principled young athletes like eileen gu are hopefully the way of the future all hail the  of gu,1
the  gu ai lin,1
well done china,1
athletes shine but the closed loop is a disaster complaints about the food inside the closed loop have been mounting with athletes media and other personnel posting on social media about the lack of quality variety or healthy choices at the available restaurants including the canteen at the main media centre  one hotel manager even admitted to cnn that the food in one of their own restaurants is disgusting fresh fruit is hard to find and no snack items or hot food are allowed to be delivered to guests into the bubble from outside the only shop in the  sells  packaged snacks a small number of  items and chinese beer  and the shelves are often  those who were able to visit beijing before the pandemic have lamented their disappointment about the poor choices available in a city that is famous for its excellent food even the   restaurant at the  is often overcrowded with people taking videos for social media and they warn customers that it could take 40 minutes to be served and despite the  food delivery system  which lowers plates of food via a wire from purple,1
half way thru this spectacular event and it is already a huge success by any standards,1
i wouldnt be surprised if eileen gu gets peng   meaning that she has to go on dates with crusty old  leaders  afterwards shell have to say she wasnt assaulted or  do something to her family,1
china have to do its winning for itself and the americans talk about  strategy,1
if cheating were an official olympic event china would surely win the gold,1
who i never heard of anyone talking about her at a dinner table or at a bar   what is  her name again  what are is your neilson viewer count is viewership up or down this olympics,1
china cheating at the olympics  no way,1
china makes history every times china s green energy and super management of the chinese  it is warmest welcome in the cold weather,1
congrats eileen gold for all the haters please crawl back in your hole and cry ab it,1
thank you for highlighting the beijing winter olympic games and the new sensation of eileen gu representing china well done,1
any updates on it how was it did it work,1
really fantastic,1
come  you're all the best,1
the spirit of challenging oneself limit is the olympic spirit,1
gold medal handsome handsome elegant temperament noble moral character exquisite exquisite peerless exquisite exquisite of virtue and art unprecedented world admiration is the gold medal is he at the moment he fell in his movements revealed the grace and beauty of heaven,1
gold is not enough for me now i just have to wait for him to finish the four and a half weeks at the big race,1
in 1896 the first modern olympic games 100 meters race runners have a variety of strange  start position,1
others leave medals and high scores he left the united states and the olympic spirit,1
the perfect embodiment of the olympic spirit is great,1
what i like about  is his athleticism and the way he skates with pride and confidence whether he has a gold medal or not he has surpassed himself today,1
he likes the elegance of  ice and his love for figure skating is still the king in my heart although he did not win the championship this time,1
you are forever prince of ice wish   happy new year and all the best,1

humans living in heated houses in cold climate regions a complete disaster for the environment,1
they should put that machine in melting north pole,1
this is disaster olympic,1
the thing about putting snow where it doesnt snow is that the local environment isnt ready for it to  is unlike the 1980 and 2010 olympics where those ski resorts didnt get normal snow fall so needed help  this is why the winter olympics are held mid winter  so the area has likely settled into its winter pattern  but because of climate change normal winter places are not getting as cold so get winter rain instead of snow in some storms,1
and a disaster for humanity,1

everyone remembers the story that the western media spread to the whole world about the alleged use of doping by russian athletes at the  winter olympic games in  however it is likely that 95 of people in the world do not know and will never know about the following fact on february 1  in  switzerland the court of  for sport  announced its decision on cases in which 39 russian athletes appealed their suspension related to the  winter olympic games in  the courts decision is as follows     for 28 athletes  there are no evidences all penalties have been cancelled     for 11 athletes  the appeals were partially satisfied the violations were confirmed     for 3 athletes hearings have been postponed that is in 72 of cases 28 out of 39 considered by the court the doping charges were fabricated  and no one was punished for  long will a person work as a doctor who  72 of the  long will a person work as a truck driver who 72 of the time passes an intersection on a,1

besides japan and korea i seriously believe that china is gonna be the next asian figure skating powerhouse they have come so far and so fast in such a few short years cant wait to see more of them on the international   in the near future,1
it is also a kind of new aristocrats in  the sports fee of 500 per hour stops 999  and then the institutionalized teaching is not enough to pay for new  the coaches are mostly from northeast china,1
wonderful dream,1
different from the emphasis on the summer olympics china had only three northeastern provinces engaged in ice and snow sports before and all the ice and snow talents came from the three northeastern provinces it is precisely the success factor of  bid to host the winter olympics that has driven the development of ice and snow sports in china the number of people participating in ice and snow sports has reached more than 300 million by the end of 2020 china had  standard ice  and  indoor and outdoor ski  may be the meaning and purpose of  bid to host the winter olympics,1
i believe that snow sport is still in its infancy in china but wait another few years and china will be really competitive,1
i started ice skating when i was six i did not get into figure skating or ice hockey but this year i started playing  hockey i do have friends who figure skate though i wouldnt mind watching figure skating as it is like dancing on ice,1

lol i waited for  hahahah,1
why is everyone talking about,1
eight olympics,1

for the same reason we people from different corners of the world are all here searching for and enjoying this beautiful song how lovely this is no matter how language ideology and politics divide us something truly universal is inside us its the desire for love harmony peace friendship and warmth in the chilly breeze thats why the moment we listened to this song we already knew this is good and we want more of it may everyone enjoy the best of health and more happiness this year,1

what about all the villages that get removed to make way for the olympics all the comments in this channel are bots or  paid to praise the government its embarassing reading them as you can see its all scripted  please explain how green it is to continually drain natural lakes and transport the water then use electric snow making machines to turn it into artificial snow that have been running for months  just for the olympics green credentials  china dont know the meaning of the word just more preposterous  that none in the west,1
you mean interrogation,1

i think you realize by now worst than the  regime is now the perfect capitalism multi billionaire tycoons rulers of the world have no intentions to dream forward we never have to deal with so wealthy tycoons feeling so miserable poor that they must treat us all as perfect hostages as beggars of a social pension just enough to pay the russian gas bill for the home heating and finance further wars to keep our lives under threat  power is about the extermination camps guardians to murder us slowly because otherwise they worth nothing think about it what money can do for those who have all the money in the world they  they can not share dreams ambitions and supporter wishes as l do making donations without any money well theres people capable to murder me of envy making such donations without any money because  nothing in this world should be for free not even the air we breathe thats about power guys think about  vision of world do we want after all if anyone invented religions is to remind us the hell purgatory infernal agony is elsewhere here on earth we have the,1
you can bring in the human rights matter too because giving young generations the chance to follow a sports career is about human rights friends just do not ask what a huge frustration for a supporter like me unfit to travel and enjoy olympic games for real as a tourist in beijing these days human rights is about to give the chance anyone to earn enough money walk free and enjoy to travel as true supporter to be there now that we use web connection as working tool as most tv reporters on the road think about it what is more convenient for you too olympic games organizers and sports competitions managers,1
why do you have so many books with the same title in your collection dont you find that just a little bit strange,1
congratulations china for promoting world peace through self restraint and helping other needy countries god bless china abundantly,1
it looks like he lives in a closet,1
china shows the integration of many provinces consisting of 57 different ethnic groups into one nation with one shared future for all china has 2000 years of experience in becoming one nation as the eu is still just a baby in terms of unification of many different groups of people even the usa with its less than 250 years of history is an infant in unifying large groups of people into one nation with one future for all the west still has to learn from the east instead of feeling superior and underestimates the much older civilization,1
good job and support    bravo to china rise peacefully and be strong      together for a shared future,1

pascal please correct yourself you started your video by saying   but most people do not  so hat its   it gets very little attention to correct you only us  uk  uks colonies ie canada australia  nz and a sprinkling of  european countries dont like the beijing winter olympics over 140 countries ie the  think the beijing olympics is  publicity again a  only the western press reuters bloomberg   nyt   us  media are bad mouthing and  this winter olympics in every respect  eileen     are used by us to subvert this games,1
the usa and some of the western countries sucks,1
100 green nope watch videos of the games  and all the news watch  another lie from the  if you are going to cover a story  do it 100  not just  narrative,1
actually we are enjoying more because of all those  from the west just keep barking outside of china that is a entertaining show too,1

winter olympics is going to inspire a lot of winter sports following in the worlds most populous country with the highest mountains and most mountains this is a huge opportunity for development of sports in  apparent controversies are a great attraction for the world to pay attention to real sportsmanship,1
excellent presentation amazing showcase to further reinforce  coming of age and to take its rightful place at the global table,1
it is because china is now the new global leader and the usa cant take it thats all,1
winter olympics were always the small brother of the summer olympics but yes it has become political artificial snow is not really green but the focus on  is good if believable,1
10 countries  but 110 are attending the event,1
it is nearly a week into the winter olympic and it looks like it will be the greatest winter olympic ever,1
i have heard a lot of stories about olympic athletes given inadequate meals especially compared to chinese athletes judges favoring chinese athletes and top olympic athletes being forced into  under the guise quarantine,1
i like that  is at the press conference he seems sober and calm can handle answering questions properly his personality is elegant and formal i also like  who is among the people waiting for him in front of the press room he looks friendly and lovely to everyone his expression seems to be with familiar people i like both of him and have seen him for a long time,1
thank you for showing,1
who wanted to steal someone else's glory and distract the attention of the press from the  of the olympic games on,1
many athletes have olympic gold but those who really saw a worldwide fever are rare in figure skating i believe that  witt  kim  have achieved this but i dont see anything similar to  which hit the world in   and even after 8 years  is still going strong conquering more and more public   power is inexplicable and he doesnt even try to be famous he doesnt use social media and he doesnt like the celebrity status he is so embarrassed to always be the center of attention before the other skaters i love   forever,1
are the champion of our heart you dare to challenge the spirit to the over all others you do not ice but art you are the figure skating itself we will always support you please praise yourself you are already a legend two consecutive of becoming the olympic champion in the world only you you are the best this two days have been unhappy in the cry but after seeing your smile you have millions of fans in china we all support you be happy and we will support you in all your decisions,1

looks sustainable until it is empty because no one turns up carbon footprint massive due to a dictator with no idea about  the game in a nice way eastern thought also need to consider western thought if you always think you are the best you are a failure,1
welcome all people around our world come to  olympic game 2022,1
the comment section is delightful as always like a  storm with a floating dumpster on fire lol,1
2022 winter,1
over 2 million dead 100s of millions made sick billions of lives  not propaganda a world that opened its heart and wallet to help a nation out of  not propaganda the  by the chinese communist government over what happened at the    not propaganda a chinese communist government that took all the hard work and energy of its people put it on the end of a dagger and plunged it in the back of an innocent  a metaphor for truth,1
commie,1
boycott the winter olympics in beijing in 2022 as of february 17th the worldwide death rate is  thanks for the gift  china you could have prevented hundreds of thousands of deaths had you shut your airlines down going to world destinations just like you shut down your internal flights no excuse for your behaviour,1

well deserved for going to the genocide olympics and  the most dangerous regime in human history,1
beijing  wants that for us note how beijing  democrat party policies hurt the middle class,1
like anyone should be surprised of horrid conditions in a communist country i was in bejing for a work project nine years ago put up in a private hotel on a secured campus owned by a  art dealer and living quarters were still somewhat below standards for any american but i will say we were fed extremely well our hosts warned us about sticking close to them and were always looking out for our safety i can only imagine how much more challenging things might have been if we were completely on our own,1

beijing olympics is a disaster lol what a failure,1
incorrect,1
western hegemony is for sure is over,1
talk about an obvious propagandistic boot licking title,1
western countries are so so jealous of  success  there are so many hypocrites in the west especially the americans  their so called rule only applies to you and none for me attitude,1
as far as iam concerned americans commit human rights  much as the  winter games are made to make the world a much better place to live  unite the world economically in terms of trade and diplomatic,1
not many world leaders actually attended though only saudi pakistan russia kazakhstan the large and powerful economies in us japan india eu all,1
without anyone intending it the beijing winter olympics 2022 is a milestone that marks the end of the western era and the beginning of the asian  world is at the winter olympics with china but the  west is not out of their own doing they are left behind,1
there he    welcome,1
are you a  wholly subsidiary,1
people say singapore is a us lapdog well this report seems to confirm that impression,1

wow hes outfit,1
i love adam  hes so sweet,1
everything people hate about the vaccine mandates isolation and social distancing is everyday life in china china started this viral nightmare we have no business in china for anything and the business people selling out their morality for dollars should all be locked up,1
loved hearing adams commentary i once met him at his rink in new jersey  he was so nice,1
adam should join johnny  tara just  not sure if they would enjoy that but i think he would bring a sense of humor and goofiness aka making something a lot of people find fairly entertaining as far as olympic sports go really entertaining,1
every nation and athlete that attended this olympics will go down in history as supporters of genocide,1
hello adam,1
how is this a sport,1
where is snoop  kevin these guys suck,1
femme fatale bronze medalist adam  his butt is bigger than all the female figure skaters combined,1

if you watch just split second before she bails she gets stuck in the splits mode where both her legs spread out like doing the splits thats the moment you know youre  dont ski but i play ice hockey and similar situation rarely happens when your skate catches a bad edge on the ice difference is she was flying down at 80 mph dam,1
this was not the right music for this story,1
this is a video where we needed to no the dislike count so we didnt have to watch it,1
folks she is recovering as she had surgery for a  fracture her  was an open fracture thru the leg i would have been grossed out by that even as a previous  shell be flying back to the states for more recovery,1

the  and ioc needs to stop  from competing i know both appealed to have her suspended and this is the cass fault but surely  and ioc can work harder,1
you can prepare all you want but that doesnt help you win against athletes who choose to dope and worse get away with it,1
you can train for your whole life but if you are not from a country where your coaches are paid to give you drugs to enhance your training then you have no chance  good luck to the honest athletes,1
shame on you,1

what a   figure skater  her performances her case is complicated 1 the sample was from december and it took 45 days to announce the results while the normal period is 20 days just a trace of  of the drug a trace so  more questions than answers 2 all other samples are clean 3 she seem not need any drug she is young and strong also it is not an athletic people love her for the   also the  should do their job not pressuring her without media without announces because it is  to imagine what damage to her psyche can apply but despite all of the pressure she showed the highest scores right now,1
what a farce please give me a break,1
who said sport was clean,1
contamination hmmm,1
people cant leave her alone,1
sample shows 3 substances related to treating heart condition,1
im not buying the mistake story at  doesnt make sense,1
funny  made excuses with her grandfathers drug to avoid  action i dont think she deserves an olympic medal i feel sorry for the many athletes who trained honestly and participated in the olympics without doping,1
i feel poorly for both her and her competitors and for all the other athletes who believe in clean sport and true competition in her case she has tremendous natural talent obvious drive and dedication yet she fell victim to a corrupt system that wants to ensure certain outcomes instead of bringing out the best of their athletes she was let down by those she thought were supporting her,1
quote from   wiki example of  false positive test from  was banned from competition for six months after a urine sample taken in february  tested positive for   initially reduced her suspension from four years to two years because of  testimony that she did not knowingly ingest the  drug but would not reduce it further without evidence of the source of the  upon analysis of both opened and sealed bottles of cooper complete elite athletic  the court of  for sport determined that the  were the source and reduced  suspension to six months the suspension expired on september 3  however as united states swimming world championship trials occurred during her suspension cox was not able to qualify for the 2019 world,1
my opinion any event where winners are debated by people  not by time is really just a game to many judgmental rules are involved this bares no interest at all but most olympic events that are use time to dictate the winners are the true sport that competitive angled edge defines a contest,1
cheater,1
yes i also empty my daily  pills into someone elses heart medicine very very common,1
,1
cheater,1
doping as a trivial offence nowadays shocking,1
are they really going to try and claim that this skater accidentally took three of her grandfathers heart medication thats the best excuse her coaches could come up its so stupid that its just another insult to every other clean skater and clean athlete at the games if she medals there will be no ceremony so none of the women  with get their moment to stand on that podium something they work their whole lives for the americans won the silver medal in team skating and they dont get their moment because of her and her coaches it is going to years for skating to recover from this mess they made it was so simple if you dope you are banned,1

it is recommended that the chinese government allow athletes to travel around during the winter olympics and even allow athletes to visit the places they want to visit so that they can see how terrible china is portrayed in the western  i believe this will dramatically change the perception of these athletes and affect their family and friends who are all screened for the vaccine,1

a government does not allow you to know the past because it was born in injustice does not allow you to see the truth because its hands are full of sin does not allow you to think for yourself because lies have taken the place of truth does not require you to be moral because human nature inspires justice does not allow people to know the world,1
i can assure you in the western press that she's been red and manipulated,1

its unfair for other skaters,1
quit crying whiner,1

whatevers adam had done to his face is kinda uncanny valley vibes,1
adam needs his own show his students are lucky to have him as a coach but having him as commentator could have been so much fun,1
when i first saw  skate last week i was in tears because of how amazing her talent was to me i was inspired when the news broke after that i was thinking how could pills make someone skate like that its about more than that though after watching her tonight i realized it didnt feel right seeing her win first place even though her talent was undeniable with or without cheating i didnt want to accept this but its not fair,1
i completely agree,1
ti si  i,1
as a russian my first reaction was offensive to adam  but now i must admit that he is right shame on doctors and trainers of  for such irresponsible reaction gold medal for russia is not worth all that hate those who really guilty for that doping must have courage to admit their fault and cancel  performance she will still have enough starts in her future to prove everyone shes the best,1
you are crazy,1
force robots labor,1
ruining more jobs,1
think of it this way what if the old soviet russia spent their money not only on military but more on propaganda like this ussr will most likely to be still here or even  already controlling the world,1

what major bullshit comment she was positive the first days of january missed out 2  to entirely recovery and test  as the rules request otherwise she would never have been able to get on  the plane to bejing as the restrictions are very  you know spend some time  with your girlfriend  is not a goal for an olympian training years for this event assuming this post is made for manipulating is only possible  people who dont understand the  rollercoaster of this girl  besides this it was not mentioned in the guidelines there was mentioned that after 2 neg tests within at least 24 h  they are released  not to mention that there was a recovery document the   her antibodies no whatsoever symptoms and neg testing kim is the most honest human being stop assuming she is a manipulating piece of  was very happy excited and full of positivity towards this games,1
the village is awesome and high tech there are robots everywhere the rooms are nice everything is nice and clean food and laundry is free what is there to  about many people in china dont have any food to eat and live in total misery and you complain about food been the same madam you are having a very good  grateful for what you have i wish my room was as nice as the one you have and with free house keeper to clean up after my room the korean restaurant in the village has free food tell someone to get food from them to give you or maybe if someone brings you food from a super market you can cook them in your room sorry that place is not a palace dont expect every place you go to be a palace you can get the virus without wearing masks and if you kiss people in the face and they kiss you now concentrate on getting better so you can compete in a few weeks and dont think about all the bad things around you many things are nice in there,1
with such weak mental  kim will definitely excel in drama competition rather than competing in olympics,1
she better go home and enjoy her free of freedom fresh with  air,1
anything that is  the western media will jump on the bandwagon they just love this kind of drama,1
we must never let the communistic autocracy hold the olympics again,1
cry ab it,1
well andy  you really put the  pile on this girl didnt you mr  journalist yeah shes a snowflake but is it necessary to stick the boot in and you dont really believe she was encouraged in any sort of way by a western power do you because we both know it doesnt really work like that in the real world,1
she is a well  nutcase in belgium,1
if i were the girl i will stay away from my teammates and girlfriends as far as possible to make sure none of them unluckily touched the  virus that remained from my body or clothes or gears,1
belgian olympic committee ought to be fined for knowingly allowed an infected athlete to go to beijing to compete,1

that shakes the biggest shame in the history of world volleyball of all time the american national team and,1

two teams were playing an excellent game but seems usa used more  forms of attacks in the game impressive i also like  strong and clever attack every member of two teams earned our respect and applause,1
congratulations usa,1
knows exactly where to get a score so impressive,1
too bad the audio  video are not synchronized the sound is a full 9 seconds ahead of the picture throughout,1

it's like  thank   i'm,1
i don't know how wonderful the olympics would have been if it weren't for the corona  but maybe because it was the corona  volunteer might have put extra effort into hospitality i wanted to volunteer if i didn't have a basic disease,1
there are no koreans,1
similar like dining hall sea games,1
the victim of the perpetrator,1
at that  i thought it was common sense to treat people like  but the situation in china made me realize that we are really sincere in our courtesy and,1
the main point is that all the anchors are smiling  and they look very  and their conversations are very casual and,1
it's a real soup  but it's not a  but it's an athlete's meal,1
programs to capture the dynamic of korea,1
the festival should be like  so the atmosphere can be different due to the  and the traffic can be  but it should not be controlled by the  and the accommodation and food should be,1
is not the latest  but an old tradition of ours  the wonderful wisdom of our,1
no matter how much korea seems to be fighting with each  i still believe that the national character is  that we take care of our  that we take care of athletes from other  that we want everyone to compete in good  and that no one should take care of athletes from other countries,1
the olympics have been held in three east asian countries for four years since  and the world will surely feel that the best country in east asia is south,1
korea is the best guest,1
my  they hurt my eyes,1
,1
let's play the olympics in,1
korean can imitate what chinese culture is ancient korea copied a lot chinese           most surnames copy,1
a small country with a national character like the koreans is very easy to get  this era when public opinion is manipulated by various  from the united states the age of social media in which everyone uses corporate  anger of the koreans is very easy to be  this anger will not be directed at their boss america koreans oppose   believing that it damages their pride and dignity but i read a lot of korean articles and the  that koreans oppose refers specifically to china koreans never write about opposing us manipulation of korean politics the korean  all the time is just a new owner from china to the united states,1
s korea is the first country in the world to claim the right of chinese culture it is funny,1
i had a genetic test in october last year and the results showed that i have 27 korean genes no one,1
this is infuriating  argentina does the same with many of our traditional food paraguay as does brasil claiming that  our traditional drink is also theirs people love to claim what is not theirs china does have its traditional dress  the  i believe is called why go for koreans  idiots,1
koreans should be happy instead of angry for what china is claiming they do it because korean culture is far more popular and superior to theirs as seen in the recent global popularity,1
im australian even i know  is korean   and is so beautiful when worn by them  stop faking it china,1
its disgusting that large countries try to steal from smaller better     this made me subscribe to you  nice recommendation  ty,1
is there a possibility because there are korean people in china i know there are native korean people as a minority in china they have chinese citizenship but has korean as native language and dress in korean traditional clothing but i heard from my roommate that some korean people dont accept them and dislike them,1
tokyo corona olympic,1
definitely no  beds for them,1
better than tokyo olympics,1
make sure to ask for fukushima radioactive raised crops  they love poisoning foreigners,1

very beautiful video and storytelling  very professional editing  well done nico,1
as always this is an amazing video and your channel is  underrated there were a lot facts mentioned in this video that i  know,1
brilliant presentation professionally done with short summary of past and present olympic hosting notes love it,1
as chinese  as beijing  we are not so concerned about the olympic  because our rich and happy life does not need to be recognized by the olympic games and  as for the attitude towards the united  we do not want him to point at the united states to bring the  bring  bring bad luck and be grateful for the arrival of the united states government,1
western media but at what cost,1
what can i say love it,1
in short will there be medals handed out if the answer is yes then yes it will be a success at least for the athletes what is really hypocritical though is the boycott from the media we all know it is a political event but its original olympian spirit puts friendly competition before all else while a boycott is pretty much the opposite olympic games in germany 1936 the americans were there,1
believe in the,1

no one will ever forget what china did worldwide wheres the honor for all those who passed and r still compromised even millions of their own ppl the world has no respect for a country that pays a trillion dollars on the olympics to impress but wont offer all countries trillions for damages they incurred worldwide the past 2 years u dont get respect by showing off with visual effects at the olympics u gain worldwide respect when u own up to what u did and pay each country for it,1

the chinese have a saying that the best choice is to keep your mouth shut,1
not a word for now it brings higher imagination ha ha,1
foreign athletes should speak up since they are finally in china to see the real truth for themselves they should let the world know how they have been lied by their u s gov  media like how they were lied about the weapon of mass destruction in the middle east that helped the u s killed millions of people in the region speaking up will save lives and prevent unnecessary wars going against the western narrative may look un cool but god will be proud the right thing is never easy but it is the right thing to do,1

i feel sick when listening to these two ladies conversations are they fair and unbiased media people apparently not to be honest i clicked in this video by accident and was surprised by their ignorance and stupidity  they were gossiping rather than reporting the news based on the fact,1
evil empire regan once said to ussr,1

can we say,1
why fox is also part of the problem,1
the owners of the winter olympics are athletes not politicians nor  who grumble all day long,1
china number 1,1
get politics out of sports  despite a super negative western media approach  the athletes have been pretty honest and positive of their olympic experience in bj and all can see how well organize the games have been with superb coverage bravo to all the volunteers that have made all athletes feel welcome and a very successful games,1
the countries that announced a boycott of the   of winter have been totally ridiculed showing their falsehoods and double standards when criticizing china,1
we are deeply happy that china has been the host of the winter olympics tradition in every detail harmony cleanliness respect and beauty in abundance,1
i have not watch winter olympics in the last  before in uk thanks to our politicians and bbc a lot of my friends and family are interested in china and have cancelled our holiday to japan and go to china instead we live the winter olympics and he mascot that went to the moon and mars,1

tiger comments here are better than the video,1
some hate hu,1
if the karma created by thousands of disasters will not die when it  the result will be returned to you by the six  the sea of suffering is boundless,1
in addition to  please use your influence to pay attention to the abducted women in  and express your thanks,1
would you believe that there are gates of death and hell in this  last night i had a dream where you were dragged to 18 and burned in hell and you couldn't die if you wanted to,1
all those who climb the wall downstairs report the party said you can climb the wall please show proof,1
it's easy for you to go on with your stupid nonsense,1
give all the money to party old hu did you do that,1
no one can offend  even if sport has to be  it's only in their head,1
don't be  don't eat dirt and bark with the us,1
because sponsoring china is not seen as insulting by westerners,1
there is no doubt that taiwan will always be on the alert to strengthen its military arsenal and link up its allies to counter china's,1
china is rich in talent but constrained by the communist  the road ahead will not be smooth,1
i dare not criticize china because it is so big and has so many people that it is not easy to govern but i always feel that china should be more democratic and more liberal,1
the us literally allows its own citizens to die in the streets due to no  while at the same time having the largest gulag system ever to exist on earth and then have the  to talk about everyone else,1
humphries a canadian skater won gold for the us,1
a chinese skater won a medal for the us,1

the billions or trillions the us spends or gives the military industrial complex is criminal we should be protesting since after all its our taxes,1
thank you,1
ministry of  defense is so snowflake,1
so the  wants to break a place on ethnic lines that have been going on since colonialism,1
this is all because of,1
lovely,1
when everybody was   again this mask and mixed between humans can scream out can   in an era when,1
raph seems to have human  cry            lee action mo         so cute,1

you must have been enjoying  the whole time i see  there's another smile on your lips,1
look like,1
i miss the  olympics,1
you're hit's a,1
i totally agree with you thank you for this video,1
and his allies are declared persona non  at the beijing 2022 winter olympics participating countries,1
best coverage so far i found on the beijing winter olympic games game among all western media,1
it would a great and unredeemable injustice for politicians to denial young and upcoming  who have trained and prepared  in the best time of their life the one and only time in their life time most  has only once chance to show the world they are or could the best in what they love to do their  part to glory,1
the americans sent shells and bullets to the world and the chinese sent one belt and one road to the world,1
i so want to visit china i hope the pandemic will subside and china will allow foreign tourism  again,1
since   supervisor was arrested in  of negative news about china suddenly came  is in behind and control all of  quite easy to figure  have to say now china is not perfect and fair enough  who could say their countries are perfect and fair  past 200 hundred  was suffering from wars by all kinds of  it was   of  finally  people by generations have been through for 73 years and tried hard to make our mother country be strong to avoid the tragedy happening  who are afraid of china being  china and wash their peoples brain by fake news just behave like  they brought politics in  are the clowns,1
is the,1
i think since we are going to a different country we should play by their rules so participants that have train so hard in what ever the sport that they are should be told they cant compete 2 minutes before the start of their competition they should be told that they cant compete cuz their country political views are not making sense and just like that that athlete that represents that  view of their country wether or not agrees with their  political view would not compete,1
well done by showing the real and fair sides of china understanding china is the only way for the world to awake from the daily western mainstream fake news hate is not welcome in this world,1
all with chinese tax dollars which the people have no say all factories are shut down since winter 2020 just to give an  sky that we  call the olympic blue while olympian is building their career for two weeks chinese people had to suffer through their regime for a life time  thank you foreign propaganda,1
clearly slanted story i will not be watching   the olympics is a global showcase for   us athletes but dont dare whisper any criticism of  totalitarian  shu the deputy director of international relations for the beijing organizing committee said any speech against the olympic spirit or chinese laws would be subject to certain punishment during a press conference on jan 18 if the fbi  and other politicians are worried about how our athletes will be treated by this disgusting government of control freaks why are we sending them there   just like tracing the origin of  follow the money  why would the ioc choose to honor the country that gave us a global pandemic that is guilty of ethnic genocide that represses religious freedom that raped and disappeared a star athlete that censors the internet that erased the tiananmen square massacre from history that invaded hong kong and threatens taiwan why follow the  after beijing won the 2022 bid gian franco kasper then the head of the international skiing federation and an honorary ioc member told a swiss newspaper that the choice of beijing made perfect sense dictators can,1

china will dominate all areas of time not far from the chinese are really smart and,1
go to china and watch it,1
the soft  voice is too unfit to read the news that needs this impressive highlight,1
its interesting how as time passes the ceremony usually gets more and more extravagant yet nothing can replace the simplistic and joyful olympic walk where all the teams enter the stadiums in a procession classic,1
2002  20 years ago,1
i always liked the tribute to past olympic hosts,1
our vice president has the audacity to compare the horrific events of that day to the few people who trespassed at the capitol absolutely disgusting we need to get this era of america back,1
this has inspired me to resume training starting tomorrow morning heres to  and 2030,1
its been 20 years now and i still remember those wonderful times as if it were yesterday its a pity you cant turn back time it was one of the best olympic games,1
20 years ago tonight i was one of the  in the snow storm segment and a prairie girl in the american west segment one of the top three best nights of my life not enough words to describe how amazing this entire ceremony was and what a privilege and an honor it was to be have been chosen to be part of it,1
wheres the high definition video of this event i know ive seen it,1

i woke up alone when everyone was drunk,1
china always welcome all the athletes from around the world and friendly people   i really hope the people  athletes who came to china during the winter olympics will have a better look of china and a very pleasant and memorable time  peace,1
it's funny how different the colors you see in your favorite bbc filter are from what the human eye would see,1
athletes also represent their own country if a country boycott beijing east olympic games that can let the athletes do not participate in the game beijing never said boycott a country against a country's athletes we are out of 100 sincerely receive athletes from each country of course can not block some countries for beijing,1
some people in the west like to point their cameras at the toilets in china to see if there are urine stains on the toilet to show the unflattering side of china and show everyone the prettiest living rooms of their country or allies,1
it looks like it's going to rain,1
it's not unusual for the bbc to smuggle in a bit of bootleg,1
china's great  women can give birth to 8 children can america,1
the point is that the boycott is based on falsehood,1
the  administration's impotence is evident in the fact that the us chose the winter olympics when there were many better ways to do diplomacy,1
why not type english letters next time remember to add let the world see the real chinese speech cognition,1

i think they are infecting them on purpose so that they can spread that virus again,1
wake up artists actors and athletes its not the time to act like everything is as usual nothing is the same and we have serious problems i will not look at any dancing or acting or sports until people get the truth and freedom back responsibility please,1
months before the china olympic  has been theorized that china will do some malicious acts to the foreign athletes to deny them the ability to compete with  its becoming a reality never trust the   are bent to suppress foreigners up to the extent of maiming athletes,1

the 2022 winter olympic games are much cleaner than the  olympics,1
the record for short track 2022 was and one can win gold medal without actually finishing first,1
hahaha if i was chinese i wouldnt have commented on the winter olympics most chinese already know that the way to win a gold medal in this olympics is selfish and very dirty they try to foul first and then pull out a strong competitor and if they foul the judges will not judge it no this winter olympics feels like watching the classic japanese game downtown,1
this olympics is  on short  you touch a chinese youre  you faster than a chinese youre  you better than a chinese youre  youre nearly to a chinese youre  much did the olympics get bribed by china,1
fake beijing olympic,1
records to be broken number of stolen gold,1
this olympics is  especially in short  if you bump into a  if you are faster than a disqualified  if you are closer to a disqualified  if you touch a disqualified  you will be  how much olympic bribe,1
,1
hey world theres a new rule in olympic if you  chinese you will get a penalty keep it in mind and be careful not to fall over on the messed ice made by china,1
wonderful amazing,1
china shame on you no touch short track gold medal are u happy that is the reason why china must not be the most powerful country in the world,1
goosebumps,1

lets be real these athletes compete for china cuz china gives them more  this is the only real reason its absurd that these athletes can keep their dual citizenship when my parents born raised and worked in china have to abandon their chinese citizenship to become canadian they cant even go back to china to see their elderly parents during  cuz china closed its borders to all  people competing for china these athletes have to say nice things about china and this is how china advertises itself but real chinese people know what china is all about cynicism,1

the beijing winter olympics opened in a frenzy of boredom so that people were not enjoying the sport,1
don't be afraid of your goods than goods most afraid of your yanks don't know goods,1
hats off to all concerned thank you for your contribution go chinese nation go china,1
that  billion is a  the chinese are beating the world in math,1
can the chinese enjoy this kind of bed,1
can chinese people afford to sleep in such beds,1
paid athletes make videos,1
the world boiling ten  chinese patent bed order address,1
first of  it's not my  it's your  in  the entire communist country is like a   the general secretary of a large  the president of the  like a big  the chairman of the board of  the standing committee of the board of  the politburo  like a small  the board of  the political  like a board of directors,1
long live the motherland,1
praise china's passion for the olympics and care for all  proud of a strong china,1
thumbs up for beijing winter olympic village,1
only in this way can those americans who are not sleeping long open their eyes and long knowledge know the greatness of china,1
winter olympics opened the main can rub heat at home to buy pickles and food money,1
the whole thing was so  there wasn't even a  can you believe it,1
it's nonsense to talk about accommodation and food and not be afraid to show it on camera,1
i can't believe there are idiots in the comments section making sarcastic remarks,1
will it ever be possible to use ai referees in future matches otherwise humans will always be selfish or biased,1
it's nonsense that nine referees are blind,1
look at the title excitedly to think through the olympic committee to correct this unfair ruling gold medal back to china look at the end or a sigh where there is the world in an uproar where there is the international olympic committee where there is the theft of china's gold medal are back to you what can not write a good title,1
why didn't the chinese olympic committee stand up for it,1
the canadian referee must be punished severely or there will be more people who dare to do this in the future,1
why didn't the olympic committee deal with the canadian judges,1
it's great but you're a shameless,1
i don't care about the results as long as i know who's the winner,1
it's all  how do you know it's unfair if you're in the same situation four years from now,1
this is the dirty tricks of the west before there was less information and it was covered up,1
shame on the chinese,1
the international olympic committee finally took action to return all the gold medals stolen from  don't take your opinions as facts and fool  what's the difference between this and the pressure scoring judges,1
nasty country nasty personality,1
canada likes gold medals so much they might as well buy a bunch of them on,1
it seems that china should cultivate all kinds of judges so as to avoid the political consciousness of other countries to protect its own athletes and make the results  because instead of handing the fair hand to other  especially the superior white  china should have its own judges to participate in the judging results,1
too warm heart,1
in addition to the administrative volunteers and medical support  hats off to them,1
the sports ground is also a display of the fighting nation's backbone and a tooth  shattering and bloody struggle,1
thank you for your question and your support bitter comments if any of you havent already gotten your china uncensored olympic tshirt head on over to,1
i for  not to watch the olympics in beijing,1
you media workers should often go to church to repent what a pity your daily job is to frame a country and a government that has nothing to do with you  it really embodies the spirit of criticism vividly,1
returning athletes will probably have a lil ptsd after the whole ordeal probably constantly looking over their shoulder to see if they re being watched and,1

i love how there are so many people praising  and glossing over the fact that doping has been done stop hiding behind the 15 year old girl to justify cheating how about disparaging coach of the year   for her coaching techniques bordering child abuse how about blaming the russian federation for enabling doping and not banning a doctor who was already involved in previous doping,1
why are you cry you dont deserve crying other skater who is the clean can cry because of you the fig,1
it sounds like a setup they waited until she won the gold medal to drop the bombshell that makes the case highly suspicious,1

there is no doubt about the purity of this athlete she shows incredible skills and this is clearly not because of doping young ballerina on ice we are very happy to see you at the olympic games  your performances touch our hearts absolute champion,1

did china give olympics 2022 athletes an awesome gift bag with samsung gadgets and a   are the facts   like  share this video and subscribe to our channel,1
they sponsor gifts for the players that means free promotion  so comon let the samsung pay the players for promotion  samsung gave free phones and players sponsored good deal what wrong with that,1
samsung is a korean company samsung is an official sponsor of the olympic games,1
the games is held in china and if those companies are  to sponsor such gifts it must also have the agreement of the host  indirectly it can be seen as gifts too from the host country dont be a  just give credit where it is due,1
the gift bag is from china so of course the whole bag is paid by china,1

top,1
how do you get into this sport,1
really great,1
so this is what john daly retired from golf to do sounds reckless and irresponsible so that makes sense,1
pov you learned about this sport by playing mario and sonic at the winter olympic games on your ds as a child,1
imagine training all that time just to slip,1
i was obsessed with this sport when i was younger it just looked so cool,1
russians were doping,1
this is a very strange sport,1
congratulations to all competitors,1
in my opinion it should be down to the individual athlete to decide which country they complete for without political or racial harassment what do you think,1
emotional damaged,1
anyone born in the us with one or both parents with a foreign  automatically receives an american nationality until they turn adults then they get to choose their own nationality it is that simple  eileen gu was raised by her mom and grandma as a  family and solely influenced by her chinese family and soaked with chinese culture therefore no matter how many more environmental factors there are around her in her external life she will reasonably recognize herself more as a chinese girl there is nothing too surprising,1
shell get 10 social credit points for each gold medal,1
my biggest question  will she live moving forward  is she going to try and come back to the usa  at the end of the day it is definitely her free choice but some decisions have major consequences as she is swiftly  biggest issue is her choosing to support a communist government that oppresses her people the way china does  very sad,1
shes in the news   is on the   and she cant really compete for china  she has a american  but  needs her for propaganda so she got the green card,1
smart guys know how to choose that is all,1
talented ones like eileen are world citizen they can make their own choice to compete for any country,1
she has a bright future good for her want to inspire millions of young girls all over the world,1
ps please take your mom with you always keep family together,1
already angry at her for breaking the laws lmao chinese government is down on her for using social  media apps that are forbidden  citizens are angry at her and  very jealous that she has the freedom the americans do to use what ever app she feels like  she entitled to do so wether china likes it or not shes  rising star shes their true winner american born bred in america trained in america by americans what a lucky,1
agreed  you have very decent insightful comments about  right choice  god bless eileen gu away from those  attacks,1
the only issue is that china denies duel citizenship,1
she has been representing china since 2019,1
ultimately the decision lies with the athlete no one disputes that eileen was born and raised in the us enjoying all the privileges of what america can offer good coaches training venues sporting opportunities etc decide to compete for china that is her right she is a personable young woman a  teenager she is living the life with sponsors like louis  tiffany etc she gets to travel freely go to the best school her noble ambition is to inspire young people in china to take up skiing and set up herself as the poster girl and inspiration all well and good but there is one factor that comes with her move she is giving credibility to the communist regime and xi   which carries out genocide organ harvesting  races that it deems inferior  its own people that dont toe the line this regime glorifies winners and bullies and torments and mocks failures her reasons for joining china seem noble and well intended but with it comes the perception she is endorsing supporting and crediting the  and xi  her mother with strong ties to the  also doesnt hurt    are,1
i was def bothered by her decision not to represent the country thats given her everything but the point you made about her inspiring millions of young people in china is a great one,1

amazing    very proud to be chinese   but are we in fact making use of the olympic to show off,1
check my educational background is not high ha ha ha ha ha ha but hide to buy many books by do not believe it because philosophy also need to compare with the general books i will not turn the number of philosophy,1
of  i will not forget the creation of dou number philosophy is three russian philosophers and three european philosophers needless to say with the olympic games have a relationship and bacon for the british  of  i also refer to the philosophical thinkers of other countries and to allow into the taoist system of chinese dou number philosophy to economic system right yin old emperor control economy mixed yang left,1
i read books for the moscow state literature and art books published by lenin is also reading  also unique insights,1
so i believe that the russian people are not a warlike nation but to defend their country and use force,1

i remember meeting tessa in  and is he was the sweetest,1
my respects for both of them,1
im 10 of the 15 million views this video has  addictive they may not be lovers but no one can deny their souls were made as one,1
i love how scott is singing to her the entire time,1
who  her dress,1
hello i have never seen this before yes i am three years late and wanted to document how this made me feel ok will update in 8 minutes and 14 seconds,1
its the beijing olympics and im watching this for the millionth time because no performance gets me like their programs did this cant be healthy for my mental health   always be the goats of ice dance,1
daily check in,1
about 2000 of the views from me,1
i love how scott mouths the lyrics,1
needed to come back here after watching the snoozefest that the ice dance event in beijing was to remind myself what real ice dance looks like,1
i cry every time i watch this,1
i swear figure skating is my secret hobby i cant share it its beauty with any one i keep babbling in my head,1
the olympics has lost its integrity by allowing an athlete who tested positive for drugs to compete the brand is watered down until rules are followed by all,1
i wish all athletes a happy year of the tiger and good results in the sports arena,1
i wish all athletes a happy year of the tiger and good results in the sports arena,1
long arm of capitalism tripped her up  this is karma and its what she gets have fun working in a sweat shop because you failed your communist regime traitor if she ever comes back to the states she should face the same consequences as people who defect during wartime softness to traitors will destroy us all,1
so when the russian team lose their team medal and china inherit the bronze are they are going to refuse it as they dont agree with the team selection i doubt it,1
ive been subscribed you for years never knew that you are so disgusting,1
chinese dont like her because we are not sure if she got selected because of her competency or because she got a rich dad if someone got selected because of this there will a poor girl who prepared for years but didnt got selected you cant  read the comments in chinese you just think we only adore the ppl who can win it was not the case we appreciate all the athletes we just dont like favoritism,1
communist you got what you deserve,1
vincent explained how he isolated himself for months  that was his mistake and thats why he caught the virus now he should have tried to catch it earlier to develop natural anti bodies and so he wouldnt have it during the olympics,1
china set policy to protect majority rights and saved more lives over individuals rights  you can call it as individuals human rights is violated but the majority people trusted their government,1
zhu can do it,1
i do not agree with her choice of giving up her citizenship to compete for china but that is her choice not mine that being said i think she just needs to get all of the naysayers out of her brain focus concentrate and just do your best if she does that hopefully she will give a good performance maybe even come away with the metal get some of those naysayers out of your brain and quiet them down i wish all the athletes the best of luck god bless bye,1
i am a chinese person and i was stunned after watching this video in the age of information technology i can still blow it like  whole network in china cares about helps and understands her and there are only a few people with  addition regarding the nationality of her and gu although i dont know the real situation it is for ordinary people that china does not allow dual nationality if you are very powerful you can go to any country at will this is called freedom of  they are both from elite families and the elites look farther why did their parents go to the united states in the first place why go back to china now there is an old chinese saying people go to high places,1
giving up us citizenship for chinese is the equivalent of moving from the penthouse to the sewer,1
you dont have to explain i call this instant karma traitor,1
poor girl so stressful hope she does really well  she deserves all the good luck its not easy to integrate that can cause challenges in performance competition can be very overwhelming,1
i see everyone isnt in agreement in the comments keep it up,1

katelyn won the gold in  she  and all the other chested girls deserve better than  and ioc corruption med and zag were on the regimen too,1
those who defend  as a victim because she is young are also  is a tainted adult who dares to lie blatantly when the evidence is  is the  not the victim for doping  won medals that should have been given to other athletes and gained fame and  real victims are honest athletes who practiced quad jumps without resorting to vile means to compete with drug users like  and then gave up on olympic games or even sacrificed their careers due to  would be a blatant lie to claim that the drug was detected in  doping test because of her  came out of  doping test wasnt just the heart drugs used for   used to excrete various drugs to destroy evidence of doping has also  other words the detection of heart drugs is only the tip of the  has developed special techniques to keep their athletes free from doping tests and  only got caught by mistake,1
i feel like this issue will be just ignored like what happened to,1
we are with you angel,1
she has three teammates with the same coach so it is impossible for her to deliberately use doping she opens a new era she should not be smeared,1
what a   figure skater enjoying her performances her case is very complicated 1 the sample was from december and it took 45 days to announce the results while the normal period is 20 days it showed just a trace of  of the drug a trace 2 all other samples are clean 3 she seem not need any drug and medicine she is young and strong also it is not an athletic people love her for the   also the  should do their job not pressuring her without media without announces because it is  to imagine what damage to her psyche can apply but despite all of the pressure she showed the highest scores,1
athlete who violates doping cannot compete in the game this principle must be observed without exception all players efforts and dreams are equally precious,1
if the skaters are not clean they should not be allowed to skate  the olympics should  be on an even scale  not skating clean breaks the trust i  the system  everyone should have the rules  equally,1
keep excusing the cheats and  keep getting these scandals every other olympiad,1
especially if you consider that  s  main opposition were also from the same training rink as  and whose is to know that there were not performance enhancing drugs in the vitamins that competitors from that rink have admitted to been given,1
i really appreciate a more unbiased opinion on this situation i imagine it would be difficult to remain calm when  been through the same competitions the fact is as the public we dont have a good deal of information while  is most certainly old enough to understand the  of doping i do think the number one concern is her health i think we forget that athletes are people even if the situation ends up putting her clearly as guilty down the road i would be concerned about her mental health first and foremost,1
wow really impressed by   she seems to be very genuine and heartfelt in her answers  witty too,1
shes being way too nice,1
i dont want to see a quad in womens figure skating i miss the days of  osmond mao and,1
if she respected the sport she would have withdrawn from the  its as  as that,1

china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
its a sign signs have done a lot,1
made a smart move,1
proud of my country good choice from  next leave nato again,1
says the country who surrendered to the nazi and does not even have the gut to go against the us that had stolen their contract from australia,1
if   a more useful outcome then he should also ban the athletes as well he does not get the significance of  in the face of this evil empire,1
lol how come i imagine a scene of a frenchman taking off his white glove to use it  the anglos,1
china saying no place for politics in sports  biggest joke ever they have used politics in every field be it sports  and not to forget the pandemic the chinese government is a threat to every country that is free today and respects human rights  inhumanity genocide rape torture kidnapping  murders are like games they have been playing for ages and it has to stop enough is enough,1
dont you think the us president is like a kid throwing a tantrum boycott of bj winter olympics what a shame on  wonder whether his athletes will participate in competitions if they win will the american anthem be played how about its flag it appears that the american government likes to  everything  19 olympics etc,1
bravo  proud of you no place for politic in sport,1
petty politics,1
sanctioned independence election in new  on sunday was insignificant the freedom voters never turned up due to the ceremonies for the deaths caused by  virus exported to the world by the  that is ironic,1

never come back,1
1000 social credit,1
leave her alone,1
these comments are so mean honestly shes young and obviously knows what shes doing otherwise she wouldnt have qualified it sounds like the pressure of representing china is hard on her mentally give her a chance,1
im more surprised at all the comments around youtube of people claiming how shocked they are that the chinese would treat her this way i know this phrase is cliche now but seriously have yall been living under a rock or something,1
poetic justice so hilarious hope she stays there now traitor,1
i see what you had to do here and i appreciate it,1
finally an olympic event i really enjoyed,1
china appears to own all american athletes  le  and zhu  thing,1
karma,1
she has done her best she was just 15 when she changed country in  it is her parents who made that decision as a teenager she has to follow her parents but now  too many attacks on her,1
how can you quarantine foreign fathers,1
this little sister is because of close contact so in the isolation positive must automatically withdraw from the preparation for four years in vain considering the other athletes in the olympic village is not the need for isolation  everyone attaches great importance to the olympic  this little sister because she does not want to end the journey of the olympic games so helpless sad is also china's fault may be the new,1
even in the  you have to  for 5 to 10 days and she's only been quarantined for 3 days before she's released to the olympic  what about the other athletes who are not infected,1
cry baby,1
i'm sure she doesn't want to visit china again,1
i think it is the problem of language  these policies were not decided on the day these people came to  but they were already  you should be prepared before coming,1
we have to thank  for affecting the safety of athletes from all over the world,1
this is a big deal,1
stupid athletes are not responsible to avoid the epidemic themselves and crying to china to take the risk for you if you are so good do you ask your own country to take responsibility for you really useless,1
it didn't show the environment at all,1
how pity,1
in any case athletes are poor innocent victims of a political struggle,1
all countries  you to go to the diplomatic officials are afraid of the communist party of china hairy officials are isolated so they do not go to you athletes think the communist party of china will separate sports and politics,1
your ballistic insecure identity as anchor carry on,1
who care what china said  they lie anyway,1

heres just one more good reason as to why countries need to boycott the winter olympics there are no human rights in this country and there is no rule of law this woman is on her deathbed for causing trouble yep this is real human rights why hasnt zhang  been released all she did was report on the chaos that existed in  during the outset of the virus hows it going to look if she dies in prison countries  the olympics might want to put her name in the forefront as to the reason why they are  the winter olympics along with all the egregious atrocities in,1
so grandiose and  so magnificently construction,1

malicious conspirators from multiple media organizations around the world are trying to use me and take control of my life they've labeled me the world saying i'm against white teeth they have a secret electromagnetic wireless device that triggers every response in the body including disease symptoms and pain physically and physiologically forcing me someone to ask for help,1
isn't it a good idea to put your mind to serving the people,1
with still don't feel a good chunk of gold in hand,1
real beauty hope western athletes are satisfied,1
china olympic,1
awesome gold medal open box video,1
it's time to change the camera the gold medals are out of focus,1
2008 beijing olympic games medals in the fire even the ribbon is intact quality especially excellent,1
really is the production of big countries place millennium unchanged,1
the number five is a bit more magical than the number  the system of world war i at the core of the three countries soon  the system of world war ii at the core of the five countries has been in existence until now,1
china is so beautiful,1
not peeling is good enough,1
swedish speed skater  a  gold medalist at the beijing winter  yesterday criticised the   of hosting the games to a country such as china that has committed serious human rights abuses,1
it means that the world draws the largest concentric circle with five rings in the center,1
heavy,1
i want to know is the gold and silver really made of pure gold and pure silver,1
even if he is not from  he will cherish it very  it is not because of beijing but his gold medal,1
complaints about the food inside the closed loop have been mounting with athletes media and other personnel posting on social media about the lack of quality variety or healthy choices at the available restaurants including the canteen at the main media centre  one hotel manager even admitted to cnn that the food in one of their own restaurants is disgusting fresh fruit is hard to find and no snack items or hot food are allowed to be delivered to guests into the bubble from outside the only shop in the  sells  packaged snacks a small number of  items and chinese beer  and the shelves are often  those who were able to visit beijing before the pandemic have lamented their disappointment about the poor choices available in a city that is famous for its excellent food even the   restaurant at the  is often overcrowded with people taking videos for social media and they warn customers that it could take 40 minutes to be served and despite the  food delivery system  which lowers plates of food via a wire from purple pods that slide along the ceiling  the rest,1
finally no need for tipping,1
china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
i want to send my best wishes for the beijing 2022 olympic also hope great athletes from all over the world enjoy their game   peace  love from,1

the world returns to the motherland of the chinese,1
you know that over there in beijing the horrifically slaughter cats and dogs for their fur  skin and meat its disgusting and its inhumane boycott the olympics right now they have everything hidden so you dont see whats going on the fooling yall,1
china has set a double olympic city record,1
it was said that there were no rehearsals or drills and that the group was all amateur volunteers and it really had the atmosphere of a party event rather than a political mission,1
a song of ice and fire reminds me of the tv series i watched from the end of  to  magic is very attractive to  in june  when i heard a lot of  i heard the voice of the character's little finger talking to me,1
pinky pinky,1
,1
the opening ceremony saw the  feel that china is really strong up good moved,1
the han and tang dynasties were flourishing,1
not as good as 2008 light show and kids,1
it seems like the only  media around the world is talking about how good the winter olympics are,1
mental derangement,1
what is the dragon wall and winter is coming song i didn't hear haha,1
if they get away with this issue this is a  sport a lot of excuses,1
you have china using us citizens to win metals but openly insult them when they lose and you allow the russians to take drugs and still let them to  beijing  is really the most  up ever,1
pushing drugs onto russian athletes is approved and even encouraged by the kremlin has been for many years putin is perfectly aware it is going on these young girls have a very short sports career and are burnt out physically and mentally by the time they are 18 they are put under enormous psychological pressure to perform and win  coach already has younger girls ready to replace her it is basically a racket in child exploitation,1
declared world war iii on a  girl,1
uhh,1
15 years old this perfection and already doped what does russia do to its children,1
how does performance enhancing drugs help with figure skating tho,1
the sample was taken  on cr strangely how a before cr at stages of the grand prix after cr on che samples too were taken and,1
she shouldnt be here in this olympic,1
the alternative clip of the flaming arrow at the 1992 olympic games,1
clearly a case of fowl play,1
one question does skill needs dope,1
we may not agree on positive drug tests but can we all agree that curling is not a sport  it has  been on tv all morning for several days  its like watching grass growing but less exciting,1
its clearly a case of politics and sabotage  this girl has been dazzling and winning since she was 5 years old  long before she joined the russian national team watch her old videos this girl is a real phenom with  talents  so she was doping all the while to win this is not weightlifting swimming or a marathon competition 50 of the scores are on artistry most skaters dont even bother working on artistry because its easier to score on the technical portion nathan chen won gold by being a good jumping bean by throwing in 4  despite not much artistry she won by 30 points despite a fall and scores in the short program beat the boys and when she broke world records she broke it by a huge margin all the while testing negative the alleged failing of the drug test was for months ago before she competed and won at the european championships we dont even know if this allegation is true the media makes up stories all the time she tested negative in beijing dont rule out sabotage to break this talented girl either from the outside or inside,1
some countries don't have the skills to make  china has high technology,1
american media and journalists want to tell the world whether they are idiots or barbarians by turning a blind eye to information available to the whole world,1
america is a disgrace,1
hows aaron  doing wish him well,1
sports are rotted  by the ioc  by the many dirty  to shutdown  all the sports organizations  and re organize  by the new countries,1
china problem is   lock crash the dirty ioc and reopen by the korea and other countries,1
china steals other countries cultures,1
right thing for the us when china cheats and steals,1
lol  war monger trump  now  is plan of deep state wanting war and selling weapons while china is spreading message of peace and love and uplifting whole world from poverty,1
i think us athletes should boycott in china for the  the way athletes  in the usa for   the democrats  applauded that now they care about the athletes well being what a joke nancy  is  the democrat party just wants to pander to the    is  under their thumb and doesnt want to offend them,1
those who live in glass houses should not cast stones  get the us off of the top ten countries in the world for police killing its citizens,1
white colonist olympic boycott only  itself  like the big bully sitting in the corner of the room crying that nobody will play with them anymore while china is bringing nobility and compassion to a world  just beaten up the golden age is upon us and thats the buddhist daoist and confucian way,1
china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
pull the american athletes from the chinese games now morally americans should not be competing if theres ongoing genocide as according to  of usa,1
china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
cnn sux ma,1
we have no leg to stand on when our president claims pervasive  everywhere in our country our bullshit  claims by   is coming to roost nice going democrats quit making shit up how do you call china out on mistreatment of their people when you say blacks are dying by police  arrested unfairly in our country what a moron,1
china which cracks down on human rights is not eligible to host the olympics,1
welcome to  territory,1
if you are uncomfortable wish you never come to china again you are not welcome wish you get out the sooner the better,1
what all the other athletes showing all the detail in the olympic village but you just say the embassy asked you not to show any details as i know you are lying for childish reasons,1
this moron didnt get the memo that the narrative that your not allowed to film has been debunked by the countless number of athletes sharing their lives at the olympics,1
not being able to take videos of televised sporting events is not a new phenomena im pretty sure you were told of the regulations,1
why dont western people understand all this made for good reasons always for positive outcomes,1
its obvious you have an agenda behind you  and unappreciative i have seen hundreds of video in different media platform freely sharing their daily experience through video and pictures you are the only one saying not allowed so far stop lying god is watching you,1
with the biggest population in the world china has to be extra cautious or millions people could have died,1
those people in green should be the securities,1
i dont know your political leaning however the fact that you are from the free world undoubtedly tinted your own perception of your commentary there are a few unfortunate facts you need to take into account when you are taking issues with the tight security and controls of the  china being what it is a system that is very different to denmark which you are accustomed   that is  it is  responsibility to ensure that you are not infectious to others and equally important you are not infected because of the  terrorist attacks such is event is a  for terrorists to score a publicity victory there were precedents before if you care to check it up yourself paradoxically your country is among the western nations to accuse china of oppression to certain groups yet they are the likely people to wish you harm to get the attentions they  broadcasting rights i am no expert in such a field i have no  would be nice to see it from the other side for a change well i do give you credit for not bitching and moaning about the foods i noticed the,1
i wonder if the chinese guards would shout make way as the british queens guards do,1

these two jokes supported  who double footed a landing couldnt perform a lutz on the outside edge just like  and  and under rotated every single jump over  who skated 2 near perfect programs in  they have no room to be furious over anything  both jokes in the skating world,1
tara and johnny are commentators not judges,1
all international broadcasters didnt comments anything during her short program,1
childish,1
i understand what they are coming from and what is happening right now while its still ongoing not only affects them but also the whole skating community as a whole which it was awkward to say the least,1
funny that the investigation is nowhere completed but all yall are experts sitting in judgement of someone whose guilt youre somehow privy to spearheaded by weir and  of all people how sad,1
the whole world no longer trusts wada why doping scandal at this particular time where was wada two months before and this is not the first case of this corrupt organization why are practically all drugs manufactured in russia banned although our  prove that many drugs are not doping,1
what a shame that a positive doping athlete was allowed to compete in the olympics insane,1
they are not protesting  they are protesting against hte  doping  cheating environment that allows a positive doping athlete to slip through the cracks and actually compete,1
i feel sorry for the other skaters,1
and weir arent  of  they are former elite competitive skaters and professional skating commentators credibly speaking about the impact this doped skater is having on the sport and these entire games the ioc which should be concerned about the health dangers of their condoning doped skating and should have sent her home to be monitored by a doctor  isnt responsibly adhering to its own motto all of this makes the broadcasting of this olympic short program very hard  for  but doping caught again russia,1

hey david whats the internet situation like over there was wondering how you uploaded your vlog,1
hey david wise  arrived in olympic games in beijing 2022 winter olympics,1
the opening ceremony of the beijing winter olympic games boldly used a way that other countries in the world have never dared to  that  the whole opening ceremony did not emphasize the host's own country but showed a lot of the face of the whole  diversity and  let the world put aside prejudice and hostility and become a global village,1
one thing i agree with the japanese is that they take only the strong,1
if you can record each speaker's  it will certainly have a greater impact than if you use a third person,1
excellent imagination and strong organizational skills,1
china has gone too  the 2008 beijing olympics has eclipsed the olympics held by other  now even the winter olympics have done so well and amazed the whole world,1

zhu yi deserves to have had a horrible experience she is a traitor and should be banned  of living in the united states stay in the  country that you   truly hope that you have a life without living in the greatest country in this world,1
so the  bought some  and yet is still losing to america in their own winter games,1
the genocide olympics should of never been brought to china,1
chinese communist government are barbarians,1
dont let them come back to america,1
well isnt the united states  their citizens through societal means also im certain that china probably has a video that shows the us in a similar spotlight,1
no trouble caused by chinese americans those are chinese people and should stay in their chosen land no problem at all with those types of decisions but they made their choices now live with it,1
what the hell of all traitors training in us soil and work for  government officials becoming dual citizenship  please pick one ur country,1

why were finnish athletes forced to delete videos of water leaks in the olympic village,1
it's nice to have,1
wonderland is the name of an amusement park north of toronto,1
to recognize her character we must recognize her character we have long foretold that when the situation of unification is clear the first to lead the way to the surrender of the nation is now on the absurd nonsense of the division of the nation it's a  it's all right and it's all right and it's all right and it's all right and it's all right and it's all right and it's all right and it's all right and it's all right,1
together to the future,1
it's all chinese tax money,1
the communist party wants to use the money to develop the economy and take care of the people and not make these fake and grandiose things against the winter olympics,1
if more trees can be planted in inner mongolia and  there may be more snow in the future,1
western media lie every day to smear the mainland and i will not trust western journalists in the future,1
seal number he,1
good thanks,1
it was inspiring and moving to see chinese athletes interact with athletes from all over the  at the moment when su   two athletes from norway and canada gave her a warm hug,1
good longing,1
lol american media said it never snowed in beijing,1
a little jealous of the winter olympics athletes,1
the winter olympics show the unity of the world,1
not only the winter olympics of  but also the fun party of friendship,1
all the latest  news videos and beijing,1
interesting to see  run from torino its surprisingly modern,1
i wish this video showed shaun whites second run from 2010 because that was the one everyone remembers,1
as far as i  that stunt was sean's idea and he tore his ass to do it,1
congratulations   usa,1
p,1
winning  moves are a warm up run on 2022 it is crazy insane to see how much a  has to risk in 2022 to even be considered a contender for a medal you can do it flying tomato i met you 3 times and you got what it takes to win the gold again,1
wow the tricks that gave you medal in 2002 in 2022 is like not even national level  much peoples limits were moved just in 20 years,1
hopefully shaun white will gets his 4th gold medal  in mens    in beijing 2022 winter olympic games,1
love it,1
well  germany had their olympics in 1936 and now in 2022 china has had theirs,1
korean olympic,1
wow awesome,1
,1
,1
congrats to everyone who is early and who found this comment,1
in 20  the level of competition has risen too,1
crazy how big the half pipe is now from the baby half pipe it was when it began,1
you know the rules before you go to beijing  why you chose to come  stay in your free country and make up stories in your toilet,1
china is a candy store hope they get over  soon so i can visit stay well get better,1
it is easy to be a normal tourist accept 14 days  all olympic relate personnel dont follow this process they r not allow to wander,1
this is called a close loop you should know it before coming to the olympics look at how many people contracted the  every day in us and western countries if the  rule is loose and china ends up with the same mess as the western country will there be a winter olympics please be grateful and respect the rules,1
it will take another 50 years  to have  in us or canada or may be longer   such a great shame   lol,1
what are you doing there in the first place if you dont want to follow the rules,1
i think closed loop is great reporters generally have full hatred and predetermined biases towards china anyway staying within the loop makes you guys more comfortable i actually think you guy should not go there seriously just stay within your great democracy and enjoy your freedom,1
meanwhile in canada it takes more time travel from hamilton to toronto but less than,1
just because you want to come out of the bubble doesnt mean we should let you come out we dont owe you anything you sound like a spoiled kid who doesnt get what he wants and just cry,1
olympics is meant to be an international festival and an opportunity of tourism  however this is a special time of pandemic  china takes serious measures of social control  other countries may see  approach as too serious,1
another joker  can ada,1
poor journalists cry me a river,1
solution,1
hope all the athletes and staff enjoy the games and the village in beijing good luck with competition the mascot so  from canada,1
why in the world is the olympic games taking place in a communist country where they violate basic human  like having a game at nazi germany at the time,1
ready for the beijing 2022,1
the world will have get used to see new faces language and friends go beijing 2022  go go go china,1

world record champion,1
chinese world champion,1
it would have been reasonable to sweep the podium on the first day of the award ceremony for short track speed skating but today it is race of speed skating there is no contact between the athletes and the competition is absolutely fair the korean athlete really doesnt deserve the gold medal for being  also this was done by canadian short track speed skating team at the  winter  south korea this korean athlete stole this move which means he also thinks the  winter olympics are unfair he brought shame on the korean people,1
warm congrats,1
too good,1
great job,1

for those who refuse to watch the olympics games dont worry the games will be unwatchable anyway nbc will broadcast the games in 480p resolution video will use grey filters for all scenery and will use photoshop program to make images grey,1
yes using carbon  may be more environmentally friendly but if it leaks out it could kill having said that china is by far the best country to host olympic games now and in the future it is one country that can guarantee all facilities world first class facilities  are completed and ready way ahead of  the best to beijing olympics,1

it's just a  it's safer to let people handle your food because you might get rats and roaches and stuff you shouldn't,1
smart wok doesn't feel good,1
the freedom of gods children are beset on all sides by the chinese communist party   virus     the  left ideologies marxism nazism fascism and  are associated with  all hate god love  the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers sisters and children  refers to ezekiel  and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my vengeance upon them,1
china is really awesome and many high tech are already leading the world,1
this disgusting old lady is super evil,1
amazing china i love your motherland and i am proud of you,1
the athletes don't have  meals i guess because the athletes have very strict food standards so they have to be controlled by humans remember this was used a long time ago where you scan the table and the ordering machine knows which table you are at and then it can be delivered to your table through the overhead pate,1
what's so amazing about the fact that there's no need for human beings to be fully automated so that machines can replace human beings,1
dpp is also brainwashing green people to bully people who don't support  dpp has no freedom of  their fantasy is rotten to death,1
chinese cuisine is finished because they can only cook by machine so they are second to last,1

arent these guys hypocrites what about the aboriginals that were slaughtered and forced into residential schools and up to now a lot of aboriginals are still gone missing and that was what i heard from an aboriginal i mean these guys have no rights to talk about human rights if they were doing the same only the country who was clean and never violated human rights has the right to say this,1
envy and jealousy caused these leaders to boycott beijing olympic games,1
no one should be forced to participate in   any part of the world let china know the world is not blind and stupid  i think its the right choice one have to be disrespect by members and officials,1
this is olympic games not diplomat games,1
canada still digging unmarked grave of the native people what human rights are they talking about,1
united states killed millions of muslims in the middle east    what happen to wmd,1
canada boycott china because of human rights but canada still digging unmarked graves from the native indians,1
trudeau let be clear of one thing mr wang  spokesperson of foreign ministry china had made it very clear in one of the press conferences that you are not even invited to witness the beijing winter olympics grand opening ceremony on 4th feb 2022 it was not your call to attend or to boycott you are not even invited  how can you attend nobody wants you to be there same goes to usa australia   of you were not invited,1
i will not be watching   the olympics is a global showcase for   us athletes but dont dare whisper any criticism of  totalitarian  shu the deputy director of international relations for the beijing organizing committee said any speech against the olympic spirit or chinese laws would be subject to certain punishment during a press conference on jan 18 if the fbi  and other politicians are worried about how our athletes will be treated by this disgusting government of control freaks why are we sending them there   just like tracing the origin of  follow the money  why would the ioc choose to honor the country that gave us a global pandemic that is guilty of ethnic genocide that represses religious freedom that raped and disappeared a star athlete that censors the internet that erased the tiananmen square massacre from history that invaded hong kong and threatens taiwan why follow the  after beijing won the 2022 bid gian franco kasper then the head of the international skiing federation and an honorary ioc member told a swiss newspaper that the choice of beijing made perfect sense dictators can organize events such,1
did usa boycott or not they only sent 18 diplomats,1
what about human rights violations in canada   aboriginals,1
and finally india boycott it,1
