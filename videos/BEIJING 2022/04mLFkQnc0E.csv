Humans of Beijing 2022: Student of Tsinghua U realizes her Olympic dreams,"Dear Miss Deng. Why do you name yourself Freda? Is it because your Chinese friends and colleagues having difficulty pronounce your Chinese name?  and you do not want them to butcher your beautiful Chinese name that actually has a meaning rather than just a sound in the air? or is it because one of your parents is Caucasian? Please kindly answer my question as I have been searching for this answer for quite sometime but I still cannot crack the code of this  enigmatic love for anything western from Chinese people while at the same time the west hate anything Chinese with a passion. This is bizarre, you know, because even a stranded dog lives not far from my home  knows how to walk away when a pack of arrogant  dogs  reject him."
