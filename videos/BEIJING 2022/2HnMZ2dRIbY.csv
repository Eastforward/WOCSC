Q: How do you feel right now?
“It hasn't sunk in yet, but this has been my dream since my childhood, and it has finally come true. I am so happy that I was able to deliver what I have been imagining and training for all this long time, and it is amazing that my little brother Kaishu was also there to compete in the Olympics, and to share this moment and witness me win. It means a lot for both of us brothers, and for me, it was essential that I was able to deliver all the tricks and excellence I have always wanted to deliver. I was not convinced by the score given for my 2nd run, but I was able to handle it and have my frustration express itself through my best performance, which I am very happy about.”

Q: So, after knowing the score for your 2nd run, you were in a mode like you’d nail it again whatever?

“Well, I would say there was no tension, it was rather, how do I say this, I was in a totally focused state, even more so than usual, and I was just there, determined to deliver all that I am whatever it takes. And then, it resulted in a perfect, clean final run. It was really extraordinary to have such an experience.”

Q: This would be your last match with Shaun White. What does this Olympics mean to you in that respect?
“Shaun has always kept pushing his limit further and further, and though he is the oldest in this competition, he keeps showing what I have never experienced yet. It was truly inspiring. I think this Olympic was a big challenge for him, too, with all who’s who in this sport in the final, pushing each other’s limit. I am really excited and honored that eventually I could win among these members.”

Q: Any messages for people back in Japan who are overjoyed now?
“I wouldn’t be here without my family, friends, staff and everyone who has supported me. It would be just great if I could give them back anything through my delivering what I have always dreamed of.”"

Beijing 2022｜Ayumu Hirano says Shaun White's Olympics finale inspired him to snowboard gold 平野歩夢,"Congrats, Ayumu Hirano! The score for his perfect 2nd run was ridiculously low, but he just took it with silent determination and showed again that he was the best by his 3rd run which was again flawless, technically the most difficult, and even higher than the 2nd run. Imagine what his 2nd run score would have been if he were a Smith from the USA."
