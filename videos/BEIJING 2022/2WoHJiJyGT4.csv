Beijing 2022 opening ceremony features cutting edge technologies,"China sends snow flake script writing or warning to Israel to not be to comfortable that spring is near. Crescent moon of Islam over Israel  means sun rising is atomic and that Israel is preventing the world from becoming one. The truth is Satan is the father of all liars that seeks to steal, kill and destroy mankind. Jesus is Lord God and His wrath is coming on all nations that have rejected Him. Repent now for every knee shall bend to Jesus our Lord God the bright and morning star who is our Heavenly Father see's everything the enemy is doing."

Beijing 2022 opening ceremony features cutting edge technologies,"The 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics(no monicker) under the leadership of Hu Jintao gets a 9.85/10 for the opening ceremony. The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics(The Genocide Olympics) under the leadership of Emperor Xi Jinping and his henchmen gets a 3.42/10. The last time we saw something this bizarre was in 1936 for the Berlin Olympics(The Nazi Olympics), when Adolf Hitler and his henchmen sat in the bleachers overseeing their controlled minions. In this Olympics, Jesse Owens, a black American, showed Adolf Hitler and his “master race” where they stood when it came to athletics. The only difference between 1936 and 2022 is the fact there was a different dictator in the bleachers and it was in color."
