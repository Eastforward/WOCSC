Rams vs. Bengals | Super Bowl LVI Game Highlights,This was a good heart fought game. But the refs were completely blind this game. They should’ve called Offensive Pass Interference or a face mask call when Higgins twisted Ramsey’s face mask all the way when he scored. As a defensive guy everyone just loves to cater to the offense especially the NFL. Defensive players never get credit for anything in the league.

Rams vs. Bengals | Super Bowl LVI Game Highlights,"That’s so heart breaking for the Bengals. They had the ball, they had such a great shot. The Rams front 4 were too deadly. At least my 9ers got knocked off by the best team. Silver lining"
