Beijing 2022 theme song highlighted during Spring Festival Gala,"BIDEN (et ses alliés) est déclaré Persona Non Grata aux JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022. Les pays participants du boycott diplomatique sont marginalisés. Ils se comptent avec les doigts d'une main. Une trentaine de Chefs d'Etat et de Gouvernement sont présents à la Tribune des JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022. Poutine en est la vedette. Sont présents à la Tribune: le Secrétaire Général des Nations Unies, le Grand Duc Henri du Luxembourg, le Prince Albert II de Monaco, le Président de la Pologne et le Président de la Serbie. Aux JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022 la Chine et la Russie s'affichent ensemble pour montrer le nouvel ordre mondial. Sans BIDEN. La Russie a reçu le soutien de la Chine en ce qui concerne les préoccupations raisonnables de la Russie. La Russie et la Chine s'opposent à l'expansion future de l'OTAN. L'occident doit empêcher l'humoriste d'Ukraine d'allumer le feu de la troisième guerre mondiale. Un ouïghour porte la flamme olympique pour dénoncer les tissus de mensonge occidentaux sur les ouïghours. Un coup de pied au cul des journalistes des télévisions menteuses occidentales. Une paire de gifles aux députés français votant la résolution sur les ouïghours.-

BIDEN (and his allies) is declared Persona Non Grata at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The countries participating in the diplomatic boycott are marginalized. They can be counted with the fingers of one hand. About thirty Heads of State and Government are present at the Tribune of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Putin is the star. Present at the Tribune are: Secretary-General of the United Nations, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Prince Albert II of Monaco, the President of Poland and the President of Serbia. At the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, China and Russia are coming together to show the new world order. Without BIDEN. Russia has received China's support regarding Russia's reasonable concerns. Russia and China oppose NATO's future expansion. The West must prevent the comedian from Ukraine from lighting the fire of World War III. A Uyghur carries the Olympic flame to denounce Western fabrics of lies about Uighurs. A kick in the ass of Western lying TV journalists. A pair of slaps to French MPs voting for the resolution on the Uyghurs.!!!"

Beijing 2022 theme song highlighted during Spring Festival Gala,"Shen Yun would have been a better choice for entertainment. China Before Communism: China was once called “Land of the Divine.” There was a time when divine beings walked the earth, imparting wisdom that gave birth to medicine, dance, music, & martial arts... A splendid culture flourished in China for 5,000 years…..A Divine Culture – Lost…Ancient Chinese civilization–infused with Buddhist and Taoist spirituality and values–thrived for thousands of years until communism seized power. Today, much of this divinely inspired culture has been destroyed or forgotten. Hope and Renewal…Shen Yun brings you a message of hope and strength for battling darkness with courage, overcoming adversity with wisdom.The gong resounds, the curtain opens, and a heavenly scene is right before your eyes. Fairies emerge from a sea of billowing clouds. Mongolians ride on horseback across grasslands as vast as the sky. Classic stories of love and faith, of humor and heroic deeds, of divine intervention, all come to life on stage…..Darkness Spreads from China: Decades of communist struggle brought terrible human suffering upon the Chinese people. And now, the darkness of this tyranny reaches beyond China’s borders causing suffering and panic all around the world.."
