Let the Olympic Games begin! Beijing Opening Ceremony underway: #WakeUpCLT To Go,"My age allows me to remember 1936.  The 2022 Winter Olympic Games serve Xia as did the 1936 Summer Olympic Games served Hitler in Munich.  Xia is a dictator that controls 1.5 billion people with fear, social scores, propaganda, sanctions and designating free speech as insurrection.   Does this sound familiar?"

Let the Olympic Games begin! Beijing Opening Ceremony underway: #WakeUpCLT To Go,"The hanbok worn by a Chinese woman at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics is the traditional clothing of Korea. Not only did the history of their past record that hanbok was Korea's clothing, but the emperor of China at that time forbade Chinese people to wear hanbok. However, the current Chinese, who covet the culture of other countries, are distorting the truth without even acknowledging the historical facts. Although the culture does not become their own by stealing, the Chinese are so ignorant and shameless that they do not know it. As a Korean, it is quite unpleasant for me."

Let the Olympic Games begin! Beijing Opening Ceremony underway: #WakeUpCLT To Go,"China stole Korean culture. The top of the hanbok became shorter and shorter, and the present form was completed in the 19th century. This is evidence that China stole the clothing culture developed by Korea.

Mongolia's traditional clothes are also called the costumes of ethnic minorities in China.
According to China's logic, the world's traditional clothing belongs to the United States.
Of course, there is also the Chinese influence. However, it is Korea that independently developed it and made it into its present form.

China is ashamed of its own culture of bald and stealing the culture of neighboring countries.

Holding hands and dancing around in a circle is also 'ganggangsullae' and is a Korean culture. It is a Korean culture that has been registered with UNESCO.
The origin is that they hold hands and dance around a fire on the shore to make the number of Korean soldiers appear larger than the number of japanese soldiers.This dance on the brightest full moon day is also because it has to be seen by the Japanese military.

Korea's 'Samulnori' was also stolen.
Turning a hat with a long string is also Korean culture. It is registered in UNESCO. It is a Korean culture that participated in global events.

The 'janggu', which is an hourglass-shaped instrument lying on its side, is also a traditional Korean instrument. It has been proven that it is a Korean musical instrument as a relic that is older than the Chinese claim. (Mural paintings or dolls made of clay)

Among the foods, they stole kimchi and gimbap, and even stole Korean culture from various fields, from the traditional Korean game 'Yutnori' to the drumming dance 'Samgomu'.

https://youtu.be/ayGl-igrwy8
BTS once decorated a stage with traditional Korean dances 'Samgomu' and 'Samulnori','Cheoyongmu' (dance with a mask and long cloth in hands)

During the Tiananmen Square incident, why does China burn all of its own culture and steal the culture of other countries?"
