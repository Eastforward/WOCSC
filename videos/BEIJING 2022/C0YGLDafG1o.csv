What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"this is what jouralism should be, showing views of both sides but not trying to start a fire. Some of the interviewers clearly showed his professional knowledge(e.g. the guy in  17:05), some of them only care about facts and his daily life(19:30 , 20:39), some of them don't care about politics (15:03), some of them don't know anything about politics (15:33 , 18:54), some of them believes in the western democracy system (21:14)."

What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"But China is going through a crisis. I am a Chinese from Henan. The current general housing prices in China are ridiculously high. There are still many poor people. Although people live happily, the pressure of life is much higher than before. Many people have traveled for 30 or 40 years in their lives to pay off their mortgages. Although, but people still put the country first in front of the big and the big. I really feel incredible for this country that can unite as one."
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,The comments and analysis of the guy at  3:12 are relatively objective. The guy's thinking is pretty clear.
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"The western media never be  neutralisti从.They lie, lie a lot. If you follow the rule they told you to follow, you loose."
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"China is so good at playing the power game. For those who think China might invade Taiwan you are wrong. If that was the case they would have done it. War between them will never happen. Only the political ""war"" will continue. 
The reason behind war not happening is because they don't want it to happen. Imagine how many enemies they will make, even if they take over Taiwan. It is just not worth it. China wants Taiwan but not at the cost of something like war"
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"Just check the real elections results, those are the ture percentage of people of Taiwan's voices. Yes, we are under mass forces of influence from China in different ways, from all kind of medias. They have 1.4 billion of population and Taiwan has only 23 million. The true fact is Taiwan never owned by PRC even for one sec. There will be only 23 million people have the rights to decide the future of Taiwan, not China nor other country."
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,that older man was stating pure factss
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"This has changed my mind on Taiwan as an American. The US media paints Taiwanese as more fiercely independent, but these people hardly care. With the new arms deal, the US may as well just send the arms shipments directly to China😒. Same difference."
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"I support opinion of 2 China, people's republic china and republic of china."
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"5:18 Does he really thinks that be a part of China means economic growth? Are you really happy about trading your rights with lower salary? I mean, the avarage wage in China is way below Taiwan."
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"这些人说什么都是废话。他们的命运百分之百是操在一个八千里外的强国爸爸手里。什么”主权”，”民主”，皆为虚幻。
井底之蛙，舒舒服服地苟且偷安吧！"
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"""we might as well starting singing the Chinese national anthem"""
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"外面反中反共的声音再大，中国都不在乎。中国的底线很明确，就是不能分裂国家。
发动战争最大的收益者就是西方国家，所以对于任何挑衅两岸关系的西方媒体报道，希望大家要慎重观看跟保持怀疑态度。"
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,Most were brain washed by the green media.
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,青蛙的观点就是青蛙
What Taiwanese Think of China | Street Interview,"I believe Taiwan should reunify with China, however instead of China taking Taiwan, Taiwan should take China, just like in the pre 1949 days, if that's possible, if not I gladly support their independence. 
I don't want the Communist China to take Taiwan because imo it could ruin the culture (which is Chinese culture after all, but was destroyed in China thanks to Mao Zedong) and potentially make living there more restricted with dwindling freedom to do basically anything. And if Hong Kong ever got its independence, it should strengthen its ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan that is) and free itself from the restrictions that the CCP imposes of them. If the ROC finally takes back China, I hope they remove these restrictions and become as open as possible with the rest of the world, while also keeping the party that makes Taiwan what it is right now, that's what I think a unified China should look like. If that's impossible then I at least hope they stay away from the CCP as long as they can."
