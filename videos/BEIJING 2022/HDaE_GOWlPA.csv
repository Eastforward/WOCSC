Team 'manufacturing' at Beijing 2022,"A Russian anti-submarine destroyer chased off a U.S. submarine near the Kuril Islands, forcing it to leave the country's territorial waters, Moscow said Saturday.... The Russian defense ministry said that during planned military drills the Marshal Shaposhnikov destroyer detected a U.S. Navy Virginia-class submarine in Russian territorial waters near the Kuril Islands in the northern Pacific. When the submarine ignored demands to surface, the crew of the frigate ""used appropriate means"" and the U.S. submarine left at full speed, the ministry said.
