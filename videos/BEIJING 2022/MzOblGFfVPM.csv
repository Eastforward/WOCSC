Beijing kicks off torch relay ahead of 2022 Winter Olympics,"I am from the Southern part of India. I was very amazed to know that a Chinese woman (Luo Zhihuan) who led the first leg of the torch rally at the age of 80 won the Winter Champion title in 1963. She is truly a role model for all women not only in China, but in the whole Asia. If India wins more than five medals in the summer Olympics, that is really a great achievement. Forget about winter Olympics.....Wait a minute....If ice cream eating is a winter Olympic sport, India might win a Silver medal beaten by Pakistan by a huge margin."
Beijing kicks off torch relay ahead of 2022 Winter Olympics,"Shame on all the leaders who boycotted the Opening Ceremony. Thomas Bach IOC chief said it right, the rest of the world violated UN truce resolution 48/11 that the Olympic Games should not be used politically and even allows for a cease fire in war times. The western countries who boycotted have violated that resolution and should be reprimanded.



China have let an ughur light the olympic flame, and it is showing its confident enough and not ashamed to let an Ughur represent them, this shows us there is no intent of segregation by the CCP and they are not trying to hide anything."

Beijing kicks off torch relay ahead of 2022 Winter Olympics,"Listen to the Chinese, whatever you do in the future, it's up to you. If you dress up Korean-Chinese in hanbok at the crude Olympics and set a table like Korea, you will be asked to leave?  Ah.. Since the Korean-Chinese are you Chinese, are you trying to argue that kimchi in hanbok is Chinese?  Why are you living in China?  Does the Chinese who conducted it have any concept?  In the future, the Chinese people who have been harmed by the Wuhan coronavirus around the world and Xi Jinping, don’t come out from within. The mental state that only makes imitation and cloning."
