ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,Everyone has a strong opinion about this case yet they don't have the facts and the details about it. There must be a valid reason why she was allowed to compete. I find it suspicious that the sample was taken in December of the previous year and the results were only reported just before the Team event. She is a minor and the officials should be more responsible in handling this case. I am also suspicious of those who will directly benefit if this case goes out of hand. Some athletes and news agencies in a particular country are exaggerating their reports and trying to insinuate something that puts immense pressure on this young athlete. Shameful and irresponsible.
ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,She shouldn‚Äôt even be there. Those results were from before the olympique. She should have been banned to compete

ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,She just competing just now she is in first place so far she shouldn't get a  medial. If she has a heart condition she should take care of herself.

ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,"The drug is also administered for angina. This aside, it is very unprofessional to have a smug smile during professional commentary. Plus, the guy is right - we are not dumm.

ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,it is not first time russian involves this kind of scandals.they take this game very personal. they could do everything to  get the gold. she is talented sporter yes but she could get a little bit help with these medications also
ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,"Russia shouldnt even be allowed in the Olympics until the ban is lifted, that means no ROC"
ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,"It's ridiculous how everybody just assumes that Kamila was actually taking that medication. And than pour their hate based on the assumption. We just don't know enough details for now - it could've been an accident, some traces of that chemical in another product, she could've drinked out of an unwashed glass after her grandparent taking medication and so on.
We do know for a fact that she tested negative just 2 weeks after, winning the European championship, and later at the Olympics.
Also it's funny that everybody calls doping a banned but a pretty useless (for skaters) substance.

So guys, lets go easier on the little girl untill it is proven that she actually doped, which is not for the moment being.
And honestly I doubt will be proven, because that kind of doping scenario for such athlete who's in another league from the rest of the world - it's just surreal. 

Full scale hate campaign and bullying that 15 yo girl by grown-ups is real though. And quite disgusting."
ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,Tbh Russia should be permanently banned for the fact they didn't learn to stop doping
ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,"Doping of Wariewa
""The medicine used by my grandfather is mixed"" explained by a lawyer
The apology is unreasonable
It's impossible for a 15-year-old girl to mistakenly take her grandfather's medicine
The Russian side would have given it to drink as usual to strengthen the players.
To be honest, it doesn't matter whether the drug that reacts with doping is mixed 
in or whether it is intentional or not, and athletes who give a positive reaction at the Olympic selection can participate."
ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,I hope she either bites it or gets booed for the duration of her run or both.

ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,russia has still not learnt from its previous state sponsored doping scandals!!
ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,Just disgusted by this. A bunch of cheaters. She should not be allowed to skate and cheat the honest skaters!
ROC's doping allegations explained at Beijing 2022 | The Extra Hour,"Full disclosure, I believe Kamila is innocent. She is young and has a rising career ahead of us, no need to take unnecessary risks and ruin her career. She is already dominating the field now, and can only get better in 4 years. 

However, the argument that ""Kamila is too good, she doesn't need it"" is not valid - this is like saying Lance Armstrong cannot be doping because he is the world champion - the flipside could be true that using performance enhanced drugs helped him maintain his winning. I'm pointing this out only because such an argument is logically unsound and can alienate those in the middle group away from Kamila."
