Live: National Ski Jumping Center gears up for Beijing 2022 test events – Ep. 23,Here’s just one more good reason as to why countries need to boycott the winter Olympics. There are no human rights in this country and there is no rule of law. This woman is on her deathbed for “causing trouble”. Yep. This is real human rights! Why hasn’t Zhang Zhan been released? All she did was report on the chaos that existed in Wuhan during the outset of the virus. How’s it going to look if she dies in prison. Countries boycotting the Olympics might want to put her name in the forefront as to the reason why they are boycotting the Winter Olympics along with all the egregious atrocities in Xinjiang
