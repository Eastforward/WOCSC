Beijing 2022 sets record-breaking viewership with the Games reaching new fans around the world,"19 Reasons to not buy from the C.C.P.’s Peoples Republic of China (P.R.C.)



1:    The CCP target one industry at a time and through state subsidies, undercut the free world's competition.
2:    The CCP manipulate their currency to their advantage - down when they want to flood the overseas markets - up when they want to buy up our assets.
3:    We’ve lost those jobs in manufacturing products to the P.R.C.
4:    Since Mao Ze Dong and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) took control possibly 70 - 90 million (wide discrepancy, depending on sources) Chinese have died due to poor domestic policies or outright deliberate murder.
5:    The CCP may direct the courts [under it's authority] - if required.
6:    The Chinese people are now, it seems, the most controlled and watched by use of public surveillance cameras and A.I data collection. Western firms such as Google or Microsoft have been heavily involved. 
               To recoin an expression:   Money talks - morals walk.
7:    The CCP forcibly reeducate minorities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans, reconstructing them into the pure and proper mould (CCP's mould).
8:    The CCP force different faiths to be under CCP control. Underground churches and such are outlawed. Those who refuse are brutally persecuted, ie. Falun Gong.
9:    The CCP threaten their neighbours such as Australia, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, India, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.
10:  The CCP control the headwaters of the Mekong which flows between Laos and Thailand and through Cambodia and Vietnam. They lever this control very well. To be clear it's not the actual regulating of the water, if done prudently, thats the problem, but the CCP using this as a silent threat to those downstream.
11:  The CCP have no true environmental controls (what ever the CCP decides) and is the world's largest consumer of coal and emitter of CO2.
12:  The CCP engage in 'dept loan diplomacy' under the 'Belt and Road Initiative' to gain control of assets such as ports, minerals, oil and territory (something they learned unfortunately from the west, ie. banks etc.). Many countries around the earth are now indebted, unable to pay back and thus forced to ceed national assets as aforementioned. 
13:  The CCP have no scruples when it comes to intellectual theft or exporting hazardous, poisonous, defective goods - anything to undermine us economically.
14:  The CCP harvest human organs from their prisoners - enemies of the state (CCP)
15:  The CCP subverts corporations, our industries, our institutions, our media and our governments.
16: They are willing to take foreign national (Canadian) hostages to bully other governments to bend to their will. Micheal Kovrig and Micheal Spavor had been imprisoned since shortly after the arrest of Huawei's executive Meng Wenzhou and have only recently been released.
17:  The CCP sign into agreements not intending to honer them. Honk kong is a perfect example.
18:  The CCP are willing to allow/inflict their own people with a plague, keeping it concealed until the world's other countries they've always considered their enemies are endangered, to further their consolidation.
........and..........
19:  What a horrible scourge the CCP is to have maliciously twisted and brutalized  the psyches of of the Chinese people, in the most terrible way, over the course of 70 years. To program children in schools to hate the 'enemy' and to worship the men-gods (sic) such as Mao Ze Dong or Xi Jinping. Being  taught to have cold cruel hearts. Taught that it's the Party's way or no way. Now it seems we here are beginning upon the same path, through marxist ideological influence, in our own schools and Institutions.

Boycott all P.R.C. products
Support FREE people - not the world's biggest, most brutal communist police state.
Call for tariffs, or a complete trade ban against the P.R.C.
PRAY for the victims and their families.
WAKE UP EVERYONE, the CCP is at economic, ideological war with us.
