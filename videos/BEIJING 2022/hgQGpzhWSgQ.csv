All Eyes On China As 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics Begin,"The opening ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, like the unparalleled opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is grand and exciting. Unlike the 2008 Beijing Olympics, 

China, which has risen rapidly 14 years later, no longer needs to rely on the Olympics to demonstrate its strength and global influence.

I believe that the Winter Olympics held in Beijing will bring thousands of athletes and officials from all over the world to China to experience the charm of modern China and the charm of 

China's high technology. In the Olympic Village, the beds in the athletes' rooms can be adjusted to any angle with a remote control, and there is a massage function to make them rest more comfortable. You can't see any service staff in the 24 hour restaurant because they are all robots, all delicious Chinese and western food are made by robots and then delivered to you by 
robots.

You may not even think that you will travel from Beijing to Zhangjiakou Ski Resort, which is 174 kilometers away to participate in the competition. The 350km/h high-speed rail you take is an unmanned intelligent high-speed rail. On the high-speed rail, you can provide 5G and TV studios for media reporters, and reporters can live broadcast programs on the mobile high-speed rail.
 It is a little regrettable that due to the prevention and control of the epidemic, the Olympic Games did not choose the more futuristic Daxing International Airport in the south of Beijing, where the parking lot is filled with robots to help you park and find a parking space.

In short, the purpose of China's bid to host the Olympic Games is to fully promote ice and snow sports in China. The second is to let athletes from all over the world experience a real China, 
and I believe they will soon understand why the United States is now devoting its national strength to try to contain China."

And China delivers a good one..and US simply gave China more publicity

Not many heard about Huawei until Trump started sanctioning it..and apparently..Huawei survived and actually have good products, and now ahead in 6G..

So..honestly..Thank you USA for making China great again üòÑüòÑüòÑ"
