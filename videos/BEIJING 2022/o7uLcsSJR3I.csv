China Knew It Couldn‚Äôt Escape Politics At The Olympics Opening Ceremony. It Didn‚Äôt Try | TIME,"The Second Appeal of the citizens of Russia to the citizens of the United States of America!

Dear Citizens of the United States of America.  We, the citizens of Great Russia, are appealing to you with our request to stop your politicians from  destroying our common world. It is not we who have come to you, it is you who have come to our home from the land which is many thousands of miles  away. We, the People of Russia, want the armed forces of the United States of America and the  NATO military forces to leave the territory of the former USSR in order to prevent the mutual destruction of our world.  We are not interested in a nuclear war, but we will use any means necessary to defend and liberate our homeland USSR and the countries of the former Warsaw Pact, as we have done many times in our history!
Please leave soon, or things will be different.  We hate an idea to strike the Nevada nuclear test site with the intercontinental nuclear missile to convince you even more how serious are our intentions!  Don‚Äôt make us to do it! Please be reasonable, do not make your situation worse than it is. 
Please do it in the name of peace on Earth!!!

The citizens of Russia."

China Knew It Couldn‚Äôt Escape Politics At The Olympics Opening Ceremony. It Didn‚Äôt Try | TIME,"Although a few West countries boycott Beijing Olympic, China gave a positive and peaceful images. To China, it doesn't need to audition the West' opinion. So how one feels is up to how Media interpret it. Personally, it is much better than shit show media and US government. US society is so negative, people seem hate each other and neighbor.  Protest and culture wars happen everywhere and near daily. Honestly, I don't know why Americans think themselves exceptional. Is this a true democratic society or just in the name only?  In true democratic northern European countries, people there are happy and love their governments. US?"
China Knew It Couldn‚Äôt Escape Politics At The Olympics Opening Ceremony. It Didn‚Äôt Try | TIME,"I think that China is a PR Lie Factory and the leadership there is very, very brutal to their peoples, of the same lineage or not.  The world knows very well the truth and we are boycotting the China propaganda. The Chinese common people seem to be Communists, however the Chinese leadership is a Totalitarian Monarchy Dictatorship, of the most vicious type. China is working on scientific modernization, but they are a millennia behind on civility, compassion, morals, ethics and good will. Take a lesson from history‚Äôs King Cyrus the Great. We did. King Cyrus said, ‚ÄúSuccess should always call for showing greater kindness, generosity and justice; only people lost in darkness treat it as an occasion for greater greed.‚Äù  He also said, ‚ÄúWhenever you can, act as a liberator. Freedom, dignity, wealth-these three together constitute the greatest happiness of humanity. If you bequeath all three to your people, their love for you will never die‚Äù"

China Knew It Couldn‚Äôt Escape Politics At The Olympics Opening Ceremony. It Didn‚Äôt Try | TIME,"The most stupidest thing is to create political noise on  Olympic game to attack other countries. Olympic game should be sports only, this is respecting athletes's hard training, even with risk of injury. This political noise is not doing anything but distracting people's attention enjoying athletes performance. It is against athletes' human right."
China Knew It Couldn‚Äôt Escape Politics At The Olympics Opening Ceremony. It Didn‚Äôt Try | TIME,"I pray for human rights of Chinese people. No more massacres No more dictators No more tortures No more deceivings No more brainwashing No more cheating, lying and etc......

I wish peace and love on China with democracies someday. and also freedom on Hongkong, Tiwan, Tibet and so on. 

Long time ago China was great I heard. But there's no such country anymore. Who made China the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now? I hope the government born again this time. Bc I know many good people there

God save China üôè"
China Knew It Couldn‚Äôt Escape Politics At The Olympics Opening Ceremony. It Didn‚Äôt Try | TIME,"Of course China knew because Western media (including TIME) under the aegis of the US has gone nuts, to the point of psychosis. While accusations of China's human rights violations are put on a loop, Western media sees nothing wrong with the US robbing Afghanistan of its money as its people are facing famine."
China Knew It Couldn‚Äôt Escape Politics At The Olympics Opening Ceremony. It Didn‚Äôt Try | TIME,"that ‚Äúbrave man‚Äù is funded by western media and hes now in US, the original video has no evidence of those places been ""concentration camp"" it could be military base, prison or something else, i dont see any direct evidence of such camp, i've ask my uyghur friends too, western media is just trying everyting to make a lie, plus 300,000 ppl were actually killed in afganistan, such an irony"
China Knew It Couldn‚Äôt Escape Politics At The Olympics Opening Ceremony. It Didn‚Äôt Try | TIME,"The Epoch Times is probably the single largest source of anti-China propaganda in North America. It is not journalism as identified for a democratic society.  It is funded by wealthy American and Taiwanese who long for the days of dictator Chiang Kai Shek.  It mongers in hate and is a master of manipulation and distortion.  Otherwise, I have no strong opinions and would recommend it for lining your garbage disposal."

 Poor ittle Chinese, I feel sorry for your government and the Chinese people.
The Chinese government is deceiving the people that China, which steals traditional Korean culture from China and robs Olympic medals, is robbery and robbery.
  You should know that the Olympics is an event to show China of thieves stained with Chinese ideology to the world."

China Knew It Couldn‚Äôt Escape Politics At The Olympics Opening Ceremony. It Didn‚Äôt Try | TIME,"I'm korean, there was not only hanbok, but also traditional clothing from the Mongolian, Tibetan, Mekong River basin, Siberian, Indian, Persian, and Turkic countries. in short, they insist that all Asia except Japan would be centipede!!!

China, a dictatorship, and Korea, a democratic country, are completely different.
I'm really sad because foreigners are confused.
China continued to build the Great Wall in North Korea to eat South Korea.
I was shocked to see that our culture was made into a video called Chinese culture. 
Of course, I didn't say anything because it wasn't, but foreigners believed it. OMG.

So we're going to say it now, too. 
Korea and China are completely different countries!"
