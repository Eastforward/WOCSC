Joint IOC & Beijing 2022 Daily Briefing - 10.02.2022,"When a minor is competing at international level with all ages, should follow the same rules like others, if the Russian skater violated the rules, she should be disqualified to compete. Other athletes have been disqualified for the same medication.  It is unfair for all the athletes and furthermore, holding the ceremony of those that played fair is even worst. 
Cheating is not acceptable no matter who did it. There is no excuse."
Joint IOC & Beijing 2022 Daily Briefing - 10.02.2022,"I pray for human rights of Chinese people. No more massacres No more dictators No more tortures No more deceivings No more brainwashing No more cheating, lying and etc......

I wish peace and love on China with democracies someday. and also freedom on Hongkong, Tiwan, Tibet and so on. 

Long time ago China was great I heard. But there's no such country anymore. Who made China the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now? I hope the government born again this time. Bc I know many good people there

God save China üôè"
Joint IOC & Beijing 2022 Daily Briefing - 10.02.2022,IOC has shown its true colors in Beijing 2022. I don‚Äôt need a video replay to understand just how corrupted this organization is and how easily it can be influenced by money. It almost feels like it‚Äôs become just another branch under the Chinese government.
Joint IOC & Beijing 2022 Daily Briefing - 10.02.2022,Ioc = PUPPET; china & ccp = MASTER
Joint IOC & Beijing 2022 Daily Briefing - 10.02.2022,"Everyone remembers the story that the Western media spread to the whole world about the alleged use of doping by Russian athletes at the Sochi Winter Olympic Games in 2014. *However, it is likely that 95% of people in the world do not know and will never know about the following fact.* On February 1, 2018, in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced its decision on cases in which 39 Russian athletes appealed their suspension related to the Sochi Winter Olympic Games in 2014. The court's decision is as follows:
    - for 28 athletes - there are no evidences, ALL penalties have been cancelled;
    - for 11 athletes - the appeals were partially satisfied, the violations were confirmed;
    - for 3 athletes hearings have been postponed.

üëâ *That is, in 72% of cases (28 out of 39) considered by the court, THE DOPING CHARGES WERE FABRICATED (!!!) and no one was punished for this!*
How long will a person work as a doctor who misdiagnoses 72% of the time?
How long will a person work as a truck driver who 72% of the time passes an intersection on a red traffic light?
...
How long will work a person engaged in the spread of anti-Russian hysteria and who brazenly lies in 72% of cases? - Endlessly!"

Joint IOC & Beijing 2022 Daily Briefing - 10.02.2022,"They haven't denied the doping story. If it really wasn't true, they would say ""this is not the case"". Instead, they are only repeating that they can't talk and that media is speculating (yes media has been speculating, but only about the possible outcome). It's been 2 days and there is no official statement from any of the parts involved denying that the issue is indeed about Kami and a doping case."
Joint IOC & Beijing 2022 Daily Briefing - 10.02.2022,It is time to cancel the rest of these games and get all the athletes home safe. And to never allow Chinese or  Russians into any world event again. they are obviously corrupt .But you the committee Are as corrupt as they are . I call for the games to be stopped and never held again . If you cannot  make sure that they are played in a fair way then I and many millions do not want to watch. You and the Chinese are an utter disgrace .

This is a real provocation, sport should be out of politics, but as we can see, all this is long in the past. Politics is absolutely everywhere."
