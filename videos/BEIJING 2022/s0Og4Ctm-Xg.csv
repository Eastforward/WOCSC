Figure Skaters Olympic Preparation | Beijing 2022 | #UpAgain Part 2,"The ISU and IOC needs to stop Valieva from competing. I know both appealed to have her suspended and this is the CAS’s fault, but surely ISU and IOC can work harder"
Figure Skaters Olympic Preparation | Beijing 2022 | #UpAgain Part 2,"You can prepare all you want, but that doesn’t help you win against athletes who choose to dope and worse, get away with it."
Figure Skaters Olympic Preparation | Beijing 2022 | #UpAgain Part 2,You can train for your whole life but if you are not from a country where your coaches are paid to give you drugs to enhance your training then you have no chance :-) Good luck to the honest athletes.
Figure Skaters Olympic Preparation | Beijing 2022 | #UpAgain Part 2,"Done watching figure skating. Unfair judging, crushing small federation, add doping on top of that. How low can one stoop. This is not sport or art. it's just child abuse at this point."
Figure Skaters Olympic Preparation | Beijing 2022 | #UpAgain Part 2,Shame on you isu
Figure Skaters Olympic Preparation | Beijing 2022 | #UpAgain Part 2,I hate Russia fucking much. Vaileva Kamila. She doped and I do not blame her because she is so young to take that drug. But her coach and team doctor should be banned for fucking 1 century. That's so... No I'm done to say something but... JBH ..... I HATE DIRTY DOPPING.
