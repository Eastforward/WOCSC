Beijing Winter Olympics: Russian skater Valieva cleared to continue at Games despite doping case,"Tara Lipinsky is one of the many skaters nobody remembers, mediocre and envious and unable to recognize the giant talent of the greatest skater of all time, Kamila Valieva. There is not a single criterion of this sport that Valieva does not satisfy with the highest score, whether technical or artistic. She has the flexibility of a rhythmic gymnast, the agility of a high jumper, the technical precision of a gymnast and the artistic, musical sensitivity and expressiveness of a Maya Plissetskaya. Everything, everything that is tremendously difficult, Valieva performs with lightness and grace. Deal with it and let go of envy, sabotage and bullying."
