"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row","I will write this comment everywhere, maybe then people will think, and they will not take on faith everything that the propaganda media says without hesitation:
And how do Americans, all so honest, who are for honest sports, feel about the fact that their athletes drink drugs, saying that a doctor prescribed it to them? But wait, legal or not, you drink drugs that make you stronger and you win, but WADA says it's all right, it's legal. Is it fair to other athletes who come out already knowing that you took drugs and they won't beat you? No, it's as unfair as doing it covertly, but you keep doing it and it's no less depressing for your opponents. You are talking about honesty and fairness, but are you honest yourself after the whole world learned last year that many athletes from the US and other countries are taking drugs that are banned by WADA? After the sanctions of Japan last year, Biles showed a poor result, without her drugs, refused to continue, she proved by this that they helped her to take high places. Let's take all her medals, just like everyone who drinks drugs, even if it's for health. It will be honest and fair if the sick will perform in the Paralympic sport, and not with healthy ones))) And it‚Äôs too cunningly they came up with someone who has a migraine, she drinks medicine for migraine, but it increases her physical data. Is it fair? No. In such rules there is no honesty and integrity. I won't be surprised if all countries have their own laboratories that make new drugs that are not on the WADA list. I'm sure. Why, before Sochi, Russians were not caught so often on drugs, and after Sochi, Russians all decide to actively drink them? This is strange, very strange. I wonder which country will be the culprit of such scandals next? Which country will stand in the way of the United States to medals ... if the world still remains as it is now?)))))
I read an interesting comment from Steve here: ""If she is exempt from being accused of doping because she is minor, she should not be allowed to compete because she is minor."" I wrote about ""patients"" who drink drugs, so I want to paraphrase Steve's statement: ""If patients are exempt from doping charges because they are sick, they should not be allowed to compete because they are sick."" Fair enough? Honestly? It is necessary to take all the medals from S. Biles, asthmatics from Norwegians, and other ""sick"" athletes from the USA and other countries)))))If you have written the rules, then follow them, or do not write anything at all, openly say that the USA is an exceptional nation, and it allows drugs to those who obey them. Hypocrites"

"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row","Doping of Wariewa
""The medicine used by my grandfather is mixed"" explained by a lawyer
The apology is unreasonable
It's impossible for a 15-year-old girl to mistakenly take her grandfather's medicine
The Russian side would have given it to drink as usual to strengthen the players.
To be honest, it doesn't matter whether the drug that reacts with doping is mixed 
in or whether it is intentional or not, and athletes who give a positive reaction at the Olympic selection can participate."
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row",Russian athletes are all doping cheats.
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row",Kamila will be able to compete for a second gold.
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row",Vladimir Put in official approval for children to be given drugs to enhance their performance. Child exploitation.
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row",Anyenhancing drugs are not allowed in any sport bc it's so unfair. It's OLYMPICS every athletes work so hard to be there. Itshould be CLEAN and FAIR.
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row","Pushing drugs onto Russian athletes is approved, and even encouraged, by the Kremlin. Has been for many years. Putin is perfectly aware it is going on. These young girls have a very short sports career and are burnt out, physically and mentally, by the time they are 18. They are put under enormous psychological pressure to perform and win. Valieva‚Äôs coach already has younger girls ready to replace her. It is basically a racket in child exploitation."
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row",Duh ! Why Her Medals Doesn't Stripped Off out of Her ?
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row","The test was done in last December and Sweden failed to test the sample within 20days (by 15th Jan). She was tested NEGATIVE before and during the Beijing 2022 Olympic (That's the important test) . The despite is about the December sample. All athletes takes Drug/Pain killer for injuries, but it must be cleared or no sign of drug during & after the competitions which she shows NEGATIVE.  
It is the USA that won't settle for 2nd."
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row",The anti-doping tests in Beijing Games are of greater significance. The results should be out by now.
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row","If doping was a sport, Russia would win gold every time!‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row","So Putin is now The Lapdog of the CCP. 
Never tot this day will come. 
Russia a Proud Nation who will not take any BS from any nation now at the beck  n call of MadXi üòÇüòÇüòÇ haizzz
Never tot I see this‚Ä¶this soon. 
N Korea Kim already basking in the sun with THE CCP missiles launches üöÄ 
They do not have the Financial means nor the Military Capabilities for such a stunt. 
I guess ChinaCCP is taking a page from the Israelis Militant to use other nations as their proxy. 
Never An Original Idea coming out of ChinaCCP. 
Copy n Paste their style. Stealing still their best method.
No wonder Singapore Government under a Useless PM Fit Right in‚Ä¶Into Their Political Agenda. 
Our PM n his Administration Lackeys to the CCP. 
Not realising what it means after all that happens to HK. 
Even the EU Nations moving away from the CCP.
Sports Politics now intermingled to show support for their ally. 
The Winter Olympics the Sport of the Elite Rich."
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row",Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) =  FSB KGB = Made BY Putin the Killer =  ALL RODC ( D=DOPED ) ARE DOPED
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row","The test sample was collected during in-competition on Christmas day but the result was not released until the 8 feb.
It's timed to do damage to her career.
Similar tactics were used to prevent another athlete, Sun Yang, from paticipating in the Olympic games."
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row","Why IOC didn't ban Kamila immediately if she tested positive? Why IOC didn't release full story? The testing was routine check-up randomly in last December, Kamila's urine was sent to Sweden for testing. Why the testing result was just released on Feb 09 after nearly 2 months? Just after ROC got the gold medal of women's figure skatting team? very suspicious."
"Beijing Winter Olympics: Kremlin ""fully supports"" skater Valieva in doping row","The framing of Russia by the US and its right arm WADA is clear here both in the timing of the disclosure of the positive test result and the media chorus which came after it. Let it be made clear that RUSADA sent Kamila Valieva's blood sample to Sweden for testing on the 25th of December and that the laboratory in Sweden had a time limit of 20 days to return the result according to WADA regulations. Why did it take 45 days for the ITA to return the result and why did they time the disclosure of the positive test result to coincide with the exact moment of the medal presentation ceremony for maximum media coverage? Besides, two positive test results are needed to confirm a banned substance offence since the test itself has a margin of error. In this case we have only one and only a trace was found. Here we are talking about an expired sample and a frame up and this case should be dismissed immediately! As for Moscow's doping history, you just need to check the annual number of doping cases in Russia as compared to other major countries like the US and the UK for example, and you will see that the number of annual doping cases in the UK and US by far surpass those of Russia. So it is legit to question why the US and UK teams have never been sanctioned like Russia has."
