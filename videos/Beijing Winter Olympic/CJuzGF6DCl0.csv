Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,I'm outraged that the host was not triple masked. Double masking is only twice as effective. She's literally murdering people by not triple masking. So selfish!

Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,Believing china controlled Covid is like believing masks reduce spread
Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,N95 only works a tiny bit if professionally fitted. It is instantly rendered useless with another mask under it.
Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,"我们什么时候应该谈论中国的同意营、劳改营和童工、奴工？关于北京政权在中国监狱中的酷刑、强奸、谋杀、饥饿和脱水？中国的一般基本人权呢？

北京监狱的政治犯待遇比动物还差！像唐纳德特朗普这样的人所要求的，谈论中国应该向世界支付数万亿美元的赔偿，因为他们使用来自武汉实验室人造的 covid 19 病毒的生物武器大规模杀死了全球 500 万人？ ！ ！ ? ！

Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,"Totalitarian, tyrannical dystopian hell hole. Why anyone would go to the Olympics after china caused this pandemic is beyond me."
Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,British boycotts his own singer John Lenon and what a stupid Prime Minister British now has!
Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,Whether the epidemic prevention measures at the Winter Olympic venues are good or not should be based on the feelings of athletes
Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,"So proud my government takes everything to insure foreigners won't infect us Chinese. 
Keep those crazy foreigners in check. Don't let them escape and sneak into the city."

Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,"Just from the narrow sense of the Olympic competition, it would really be a shame (and unfair) if a top-level athlete travels all the way to Beijing only to be infected by COVID and had to miss his/her contest because he/she might be too ill during that period. So, an Olympic bubble is kind of necessary regardless of where the Olympics take place at this time (Tokyo did almost the same last year, although it looks like Beijing's execution is even better)."
Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,Again it’s the athletes and coaches themselves that are entering China already infected with Covid.  I’m happy to see that China has implemented procedures to protect its own people from having this virus spread from the outside.  If journalists are so negatively impacted by China’s rules and constraints then they should have stayed in their own country.  The closed loop villages have  been well published and documented worldwide so this shouldn’t be a surprise.  Follow the rules or just leave!
Entering Beijing's Winter Olympics Bubble,I think he is an impolite and uneducated person
