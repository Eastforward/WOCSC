Sweden’s RECORD BREAKING Plans for Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"I wish we, as a nation had boycotted it but since we didn't, I will.

I love it and will watch all of the winter sports and especially when Swedens national Hockey Team is playing but not this Olympics.

I think it's a disgrace that it's even taking place and I do judge every single athlete that agreed to participate.

We used to stand for something."

With little he got he made a spectacular lightshow event, focusing not only on China, but including everyone on this planet, with a broader international theme. 

Imagine if this was a full blown ceremony, with the talent of Zhang Yimou it would have been guranteed quality spectacle! My compliments Zhang Yimou! Thank you for giving us 2 splendid Olympic Ceremony shows, you have eternalized yourself with your artistic creativity!"
