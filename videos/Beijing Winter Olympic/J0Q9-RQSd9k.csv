The Day I Became An Olympian - Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games - Vlog 24,Q&A: Which country‘s skaters would you have concerns skating with fearing for the possibility of an illegal move?
The Day I Became An Olympian - Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games - Vlog 24,"just one more question. The US (and maybe UK too) warned before the Olympic to their athletes that they should not bring their own mobile phones to Beijing due to surveillance in China ( actually this advice I think is very ignorant and stupid), I wonder if you guys really are afraid to use your own phones and use burners instead. Thanks a lot, have fun and enjoy the games!"
The Day I Became An Olympian - Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games - Vlog 24,Great work. I am sure there will be many more Olympic ahead for you. Question: do you have enough time to practice in rink before the game?

Questions: how and when did you developed interest in skating/speed skating? How many hours do you usually train? How did you become part of the UK National team?"
