China sees rising popularity of figure skating in run up to Beijing Winter Olympics,"Besides Japan and Korea, I seriously believe that China is gonna be the next Asian figure skating powerhouse. They have come so far and so fast in such a few short years. Can't wait to see more of them on the International podiums  in the near future."

China sees rising popularity of figure skating in run up to Beijing Winter Olympics,"Different from the emphasis on the Summer Olympics, China had only three northeastern provinces engaged in ice and snow sports before, and all the ice and snow talents came from the three northeastern provinces. It is precisely the success factor of China's bid to host the Winter Olympics that has driven the development of ice and snow sports in China. The number of people participating in ice and snow sports has reached more than 300 million. By the end of 2020, China had 654 standard ice rinks and 803 indoor and outdoor ski resorts.
This may be the meaning and purpose of China's bid to host the Winter Olympics."
China sees rising popularity of figure skating in run up to Beijing Winter Olympics,I believe that snow sport is still in it's infancy in China. But wait another few years and China will be really competitive  !

China sees rising popularity of figure skating in run up to Beijing Winter Olympics,I started ice skating when I was six. I did not get into figure skating or ice hockey but this year I started playing shinny hockey. I do have friends who figure skate though. I wouldn't mind watching figure skating as it is like dancing on ice!
