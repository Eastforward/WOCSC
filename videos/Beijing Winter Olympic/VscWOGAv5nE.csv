Beijing seals off Olympic 'bubble' ahead of Winter Games - BBC News,"I don't understand China, sometimes. 

IF ""Chinese Lunnar New Year"" is correct,
Is the example below correct? 

Israel Merry Christmas ?!?!??
Europe Thanksgiving Day ?!?!??
USA Black Friday ?!?!??Most People said “NO“ 

Just as Merry Christmas has become common all over the world,
Of course, it's just ""Lunar New Year"" in Asia. 

Mongolia, Vietnam, Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Singapore, etc. 

""Lunar New Year"" is a Big-Holiday in many Asian countries.
This is because,
In the past, Many Asian Countries used the lunar calendar. 

China thinks that the Chinese created all world cultures.
This is called the 'Chinese Fundamental Theory'. 

China claims that the Chinese also made hockey, bowling, pizza, kimchi, and so on. 

But, it is 'FACT' that
Bowling is the origin of Egypt, Pizza is the origin of Italy, and KimChi is a traditional Korean food. 

Do you know “China Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution” ??? 

From 1966 to 1976, During 10 years,
Chinese ‘burned’ their own culture after China became communist. 

From an Anti-communist point of view, it is also a case frequently mentioned when explaining why communism should not be practiced. 

Anyway,
At that time, “Many Chinese Cultures“ burned down because China burned its own culture. 

SO Nowadays, that is reason why China is jealous of the world. 

Therefore,
China has been trying to steal especial ’the popular culture of other countries’.
It is in the same context as China's illegal copying of trademarks and intellectual property rights. 

Many people in the world cannot understand China sometimes.
But it is very bad! 

What do you think about it ???"
