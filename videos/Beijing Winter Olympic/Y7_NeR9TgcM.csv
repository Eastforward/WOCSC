Beijing Winter Olympics: IOC tight-lipped on potential figure skating doping case,If they get away with this issue! This is a F-Up sport!!! A lot of excuses
Beijing Winter Olympics: IOC tight-lipped on potential figure skating doping case,"When a minor is competing at international level with all ages, should follow the same rules like others, if the Russian skater violated the rules, she should be disqualified to compete. Other athletes have been disqualified for the same medication.  It is unfair for all the athletes and furthermore, holding the ceremony of those that played fair is even worst. 
Cheating is not acceptable no matter who did it. There is no excuse."

Beijing Winter Olympics: IOC tight-lipped on potential figure skating doping case,"You have china using US citizens to win metals but openly insult them when they lose, and you allow the russians to take drugs and still let them to compete.....this beijing olymics is really the most fucked up ever"
Beijing Winter Olympics: IOC tight-lipped on potential figure skating doping case,"Pushing drugs onto Russian athletes is approved, and even encouraged, by the Kremlin. Has been for many years. Putin is perfectly aware it is going on. These young girls have a very short sports career and are burnt out, physically and mentally, by the time they are 18. They are put under enormous psychological pressure to perform and win. Valieva‚Äôs coach already has younger girls ready to replace her. It is basically a racket in child exploitation."

Beijing Winter Olympics: IOC tight-lipped on potential figure skating doping case,"They are talking about the results of the test of the Russian figure skater, which was made at least a MONTH AGO, in December 2020. A month has 30 days or 720 hours 43200 minutes.
üëâ *Why did they learn about the results of this test in such a way that this story appeared in the media at the most favorable moment for anti-Russian propaganda?* Not a minute earlier, not a minute later! The procedure for awarding figure skaters is at its peak! Everyone is on the podium, literally in a few seconds medals will appear. The TV program has the highest viewer ratings ... and just at this exact moment ... just coincidentally *_(do you believe in such ""coincidences""?)_* ... the world suddenly found out about the results of a test that was made more than a month ago.
üëâ *Out of more than 43,200 minutes, why exactly at this particular minute did they start spinning this story?*

üî∂ Everyone remembers the story that the Western media spread to the whole world about the alleged use of doping by Russian athletes at the Sochi Winter Olympic Games in 2014. *However, it is likely that 95% of people in the world do not know and will never know about the following fact.* On February 1, 2018, in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced its decision on cases in which 39 Russian athletes appealed their suspension related to the Sochi Winter Olympic Games in 2014. The court's decision is as follows:
    - for 28 athletes - there are no evidences, ALL penalties have been cancelled;
    - for 11 athletes - the appeals were partially satisfied, the violations were confirmed;
    - for 3 athletes hearings have been postponed.

üëâ *That is, in 72% of cases (28 out of 39) considered by the court, THE DOPING CHARGES WERE FABRICATED (!!!) and no one was punished for this!*
How long will a person work as a doctor who misdiagnoses 72% of the time? _- You know the answer._
How long will a person work as a truck driver who 72% of the time passes an intersection on a red traffic light? _You know the answer._
*How long will work a person engaged in the spread of anti-Russian hysteria and who brazenly lies in 72% of cases? - Endlessly!*"

Beijing Winter Olympics: IOC tight-lipped on potential figure skating doping case,"We may not agree on positive drug tests, but can we all agree that Curling is not a sport!  It has  been on TV all morning for several days.  It‚Äôs like watching grass growing, but less exciting!"
Beijing Winter Olympics: IOC tight-lipped on potential figure skating doping case,"Its clearly a case of politics and sabotage.  This girl has been dazzling and winning since she was 5 years old.  Long before she joined the Russian national team. Watch her old videos. This girl is a real phenom with god-gifted talents.  So she was doping all the while to win? This is not weight-lifting, swimming or a marathon competition. 50% of the scores are on artistry. Most skaters don't even bother working on artistry because its easier to score on the technical portion. Nathan Chen won gold by being a good jumping bean by throwing in 4 quads despite not much artistry. She won by 30 points despite a fall and scores in the short program beat the boys. And when she broke world records, she broke it by a huge margin all the while testing negative. The alleged failing of the drug test was for months ago before she competed and won at the European championships. We don't even know if this allegation is true. The media makes up stories all the time. She tested negative in Beijing. Don't rule out sabotage to break this talented girl, either from the outside or inside."
