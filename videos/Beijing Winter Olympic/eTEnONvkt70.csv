"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","lol didnt even notice this was held, youtube probably blocked it at that time."
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","I pray for human rights of Chinese people. No more massacres No more dictators No more tortures No more deceivings No more brainwashing No more cheating, lying and etc......

I wish peace and love on China with democracies someday. and also freedom on Hongkong, Tiwan, Tibet and so on. 

Long time ago China was great I heard. But there's no such country anymore. Who made China the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now? I hope the government born again this time. Bc I know many good people there

God save China üôè"
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more",beging again 1936 berlin and  do to 2022 beijing
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more",Hadn‚Äôt watched much but I did notice THREE NUCLEAR cooling towers in the background.  Praying for our athletes.  Sorry NBC it‚Äôs not a coal field
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","Copycat china. Do you really want gold medal that much seriously? Do we visit on China's winter sports day? I already knew that it would be happened. Also do not claim other's cultures are yours. China has many cultures itself, so why you claim Korea's are them?? I couldn't understand."
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","China is proving their low quality themselves across the board. Foods, snow and ice quality and serious bribing.
It can be good event to let all people know who they are"
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more",Western boycotts are ashamed of themselves! Ugh
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","There was no creativity at all at the opening ceremony. It was uncomfortable to see countless fireworks go off, and in short, It seemed that only a huge amount of money had been invested, and It also seems to be more so compared to the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea, which impressed me four years ago."
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more",The worst Olympics ever.
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","I think it's weird to hold the Olympics in a socialist communist country. 
It's a place for harmony and communication, but it opens in a country of closure and control?"
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more",Hitlers Olympics were applauded too - doesn't mean shit to me anymore.
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","BIDEN (et ses alli√©s) est d√©clar√© Persona Non Grata aux JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022. Les pays participants du boycott diplomatique sont marginalis√©s. Ils se comptent avec les doigts d'une main. Une trentaine de Chefs d'Etat et de Gouvernement sont pr√©sents √† la Tribune des JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022. Poutine en est la vedette. Sont pr√©sents √† la Tribune: le Secr√©taire G√©n√©ral des Nations Unies, le Grand Duc Henri du Luxembourg, le Prince Albert II de Monaco, le Pr√©sident de la Pologne et le Pr√©sident de la Serbie. Aux JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022 la Chine et la Russie s'affichent ensemble pour montrer le nouvel ordre mondial. Sans BIDEN. La Russie a re√ßu le soutien de la Chine en ce qui concerne les pr√©occupations raisonnables de la Russie. La Russie et la Chine s'opposent √† l'expansion future de l'OTAN. L'occident doit emp√™cher l'humoriste d'Ukraine d'allumer le feu de la troisi√®me guerre mondiale. Un ou√Øghour porte la flamme olympique pour d√©noncer les tissus de mensonge occidentaux sur les ou√Øghours. Un coup de pied au cul des journalistes des t√©l√©visions menteuses occidentales. Une paire de gifles aux d√©put√©s fran√ßais votant la r√©solution sur les ou√Øghours.-

BIDEN (and his allies) is declared Persona Non Grata at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The countries participating in the diplomatic boycott are marginalized. They can be counted with the fingers of one hand. About thirty Heads of State and Government are present at the Tribune of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Putin is the star. Present at the Tribune are: Secretary-General of the United Nations, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Prince Albert II of Monaco, the President of Poland and the President of Serbia. At the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, China and Russia are coming together to show the new world order. Without BIDEN. Russia has received China's support regarding Russia's reasonable concerns. Russia and China oppose NATO's future expansion. The West must prevent the comedian from Ukraine from lighting the fire of World War III. A Uyghur carries the Olympic flame to denounce Western fabrics of lies about Uighurs. A kick in the ass of Western lying TV journalists. A pair of slaps to French MPs voting for the resolution on the Uyghurs.!!"

"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","See the quality of Chinese ice
All players are falling
In the men's 1000m, Hwang Dae-heon and Lee Jun-seo were disqualified for violating a lane change even though they did not commit any fouls. These players were disqualified and two Chinese were promoted. In the end, there were three Chinese players in the final.
really dirty and ugly beijing olympics"
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","Among all the nations of the world, is there any nation that actually LIKES CHINA? WHO LIKES CHINA?"
"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","Shameful clips, dirty intentions, hell filters"

"Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Opening ceremony, 'sleeping Putin' & more","Greetings from Brazil. How sad. The world fraternizing with a country that persecutes minorities, keeping them in slave labor camps and harvesting their organs to serve the local organ transplant market.  Diplomatic boycott is too little. Delegations from every country that even claims to be democratic should have refused to participate in an event funded by the genocidal Chinese Communist Party."
