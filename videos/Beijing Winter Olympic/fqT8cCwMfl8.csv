China celebrates as US-born skier Eileen Gu wins Winter Olympics gold for host nation,"*Forwarded - EILEEN GU BEIJING 2022 WINTER OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST.*

Eileen Gu, the 18-year-old Olympics gold medalist freestyle skiing prodigy, nicknamed the ""Snow Princess""

I wonder how her father feels now. She's only 18.

Pretty mature for her age. Her father walked out on her and her mother when she was very young. Too bad, he doesn't know what he is missing.

The orang putih ditched Eileen's mother. That is why she took on her mother's surname.

Her mother and her Chinese grandma single handedly brought her up.

Btw, many probably doesn't know, her mother was in fact a former ski instructor who went to uni in the US and used to coach skiing near Lake Tahoe. Makes sense now.

Eileen Gu, born in California, USA was raised by two strong women in her life, her Chinese mother, Yan Gu and grandmother Geng Guo Zhen.

These two women are rich and successful, and funded Eileen's training, coaching and facilities in the US.

These two women are the only people Eileen need to consider, not all the salty Americans who have nothing to do with where she is today. 

The saga of China's snow princess Eileen Gu has taken a leap into a new unknown cyber space as 500 million Chinese responses flooded  Weibo in an hour following her fearless leap into the blue sky for gold in Beijing Winter Olympics; a domain  seemingly reserved just for her.

Her brave feat proved too much for the system to handle and the system crashed!! The picture of Eileen staring with wide open eyes and gapping mouth at the scoreboard for the verdict of her herculean act was unnerving and Eileen and China held their breath as did the world.

It recorded  94.5 score and first in standing.

Eileen knew what they meant as she fell onto her knees in sweet delight that brought tears down her cheek but 1.4 billion Chinese spontaneously leapt with joy and punched the air and shouted gleefully ""Cia Yu"".

Eileen has unquestionably stamped her position as the new Chinese icon perhaps bigger than the basketballer Yaoming or Chinese hurdler Liu Xiang.

Standing at 5ft 6ins tall, with a face for Vogue magazine and speaking mandarin with Beijing accent, Eileen can't seem to do any wrong.

Global Times worked overtime to search for every bit of info about her to feed the curiousity of a  population hungry to know more.

However Western media sulked and refused to give their congratulations but instead smeared their own reputation by hurling unpleasantries at her.

It wasn't a shock to see such behaviour.

Instead they behaved exactly in accordance with a standard that they have become known for.

It was a rude awakening for America which for decades attracted world sporting elites to its shore but is now seeing its own leaving America for countries of their ethnic origin who willingly welcome them with warm open arms . These sporting elites have found the incessant daily rhetoric of threats from American politicians and enforcement officers just too much to stomach and are willing to go where they are better appreciated.

Eileen is the key that opens the door for diasporas around the world and for China the opening of the giant gate to a new world of winter sports."

China celebrates as US-born skier Eileen Gu wins Winter Olympics gold for host nation,"After winning gold for china, Eileen Gu will take all the medals and money earned from chinese endorsements back to US. I bet the thought of being a chinese citizen probably never crosses her mind even for 1 second. And she's probably going to marry some famous white American rather than give a thought of marrying a china man."

China celebrates as US-born skier Eileen Gu wins Winter Olympics gold for host nation,Well done Eileen! I find the comment about her citizenship interesting as well. My understanding is there is no dual citizenship between China and the US. Yet she's a citizen of both countries as stated in this video. How is that possible? Have things changed or are there case by case exceptions?
