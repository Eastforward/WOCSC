Inside the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics,"I love Chinese rich and dynamic culture and its interesting tradition and customs. I really do respect people of China. All my best friends here in the States are Chinese Americans its not even a lie. However Chinese government, Chinese contents creator and companies stop copying other countries' original contents or products and etc. I watched the Chinese TV shows that are exactly same as South Korean old TV show and I heard they did not even pay for the proper fee for the license.. Not just that... so many fake products and goods. They think its okay and just laugh about it. That is serious crime. and if China wants to become superpower one day like US or other developed countries like Japan or some European countries and South Korea..even Taiwan, China should act like one."
Inside the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics,"Perhaps because China has a lot of fakes, the Olympics must be fake. 
This is the Olympics without the ""Olympic spirit."" They obviously don't know what the Olympics are for. 
China says its own country is a great country, but China does not have anything great. Because they have been controversial over human rights abuse issues. the democratic countries including the United States should boycott them. How can a country with a low level of human rights know sportsmanship? everyone knows, 2022 Beijing Olympics is the worst Olympics ever."
