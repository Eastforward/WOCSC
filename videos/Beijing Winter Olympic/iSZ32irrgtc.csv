Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,So its okay to dope 15 year's old very  stupid excuse she should not skate at all
Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"Look around (and also look at Simone Biles, who actually looks like some kind of Simon and who is allowed to use strong drugs for medical reasons). On this Hell-planet injustice is everywhere. Why some people have decided that it is necessary to start with this 15-years-old girl, without even waiting for the end of the investigation and the final verdict of CAS?"

Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"All the Russians didn't die even when unified Europe's armies (which ones used
methamphetamine) got to the Volga river in November 1942 ... actually Russia (without using any drugs) became a great power exactly at that moment.
With this little scandal, because of the negligible amount of trimetazidine in the urine of a Tatar teenage girl - Camilla, Russia will not even bother."
Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,She isn't qualified to attend the competition. Unfairness matters.
Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"Disgusting, a liar and a cheat."

Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"they should have delivered the result in 20 days, after that it's invalid. It was delivered in 45 days ""coincidentally"" in the hot time of Russian conflict with Ukraine, which is hugely discussed in media, in the day Russia - the ""wrong"" country - its figure skating team won gold in team event and Kamila was praised by media for her performance and quads. There should be no place for politics in sport. And Kamila didn't need that drug, she was the winner before."

Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"This is ridiculous - she should NOT be allowed to compete, a banned substance was found in her test results. She's busted for doping - she should be disqualified."
Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"Russia is always in trouble and cowardly.
They also robbed Kim Yu-na of the gold medal in Sochi in 2014, and this time it is doping. It's a disgusting country."
Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"2014 Sochi Olympics: 
Yuna Kim should be the gold medalist! But they gave it to Sotnikova, a Russian,  whose scores were undeniably inflated both in the Short Program and Free Skate even if her performancs  recorded underrotation, two-footed landing, wrong-edge and substandard execution compared to Yuna Kim whose performances were almost perfect and done artistically according to her planned programs! A lot of people around the world including commentators and great figure skaters expressed injustice but what did IOC do?

2022 Beijing Olympics:
Valieva, again a Russian figure skating athlete, is found to be positive with a banned drug and she is still being allowed to compete! What?  Even if the drug test was in December 2021, the drug already made it's positive effect on her. Valieva may not have the full knowledge about this because she's just 15 y/o, but I believe that somehow, Valieva and her parents know something. Valieva, her coaches and her doctors  should be held liable and should not allow to compete. The act of letting her take a banned drug was a premeditated disregard of the rules and law of the sports. I admire Valieva upon seeing her performances but justice for all should prevail. She's just 15 y/o hence, she still has many opportunities in the future. Representatives from other countries who tried their best to abide with the rules and regulations and have the potential to win medals should not be punished just because Valieva is allowed to compete.

This is another shameful and biased decision from the IOC."

Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,Compete clean.Punish the coaches.
Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"When you need 2 month to examine a tube of piss, you have NO credibility in whatever crap you come up with."
Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,She doped and knew it.  40 days to get results and to washout of the drug.  ROC knows how to dope and washout their athletes before testing.  I'm sure they all still dope during training.  I am sure she is part of it.
Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"Everyone should just calm down a bit.  Let her compete. There appears to be at least some uncertainty regarding the results from testing sample A and questions regarding the lab delays and timing  of both submission to the Swedish lab and transmission of results to the IOC.  I don't condone the doping attributed to Russian sports in the past. But people are to quick to attack a young athlete simply because she is from Russia.  What are chances of a ""false positive test result- not unheard of? Test sample B. If sample B confirms the presence of banned substances, and she medals, she should be disqualified. If she medals and the results from testing sample B are negative for banned substances, she should be awarded any medal she might win.  I would also look carefully at the chain of custody of any samples tested. Could anyone have had access to tamper with them? This situation must be thoroughly investigated and this will take more time. I do not know what the IOC standard is for resolving the type of violation she is being accused of: ""beyond a reasonable doubt?""; ""a preponderance of the evidence"" or what I see in so many comments, ""guilty as accused"", ""guilty by reasonable suspicion "", or ""obviously guilty because she is simply too good a skater"".  Let this talented skater compete.  Give officials time to complete additional lab tests and a thorough investigation of this matter including of course an investigation of Kamila's coaching team and team doctors.  Good investigators would also look at who might gain most from having such a talented skater disqualified or have her focus disrupted just before the competition.  Let Kamila skate and give all the facts time to surface and be evaluated.  We need to be fair to all the Olympic competitors, including this young lady.  Why not award medals ""provisionally"" for this upcoming singles figure skating event? If it is proven beyond a doubt that Valieva did indeed break the rules by training with or competing while using a banned substance, by all means withhold the medals.  Under no circumstances can cheating be allowed in Olympic competition.  
Regarding protected minors competing---raise the minimum age to compete at the senior level to 18 so age cannot be used as an excuse. There is no excuse for cheating, period. I hope everyone competing performs at their ""seasons best"". Good luck to all athletes."
Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics,"What exactly does ""irreparable harm"" mean? Her feelings get hurt? Didn't the Russians bank on her age as the loop hole they would need to escape this because they knew they would get caught.. .again....."
