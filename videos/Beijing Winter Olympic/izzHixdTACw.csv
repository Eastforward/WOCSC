Headline Buster: Beijing Winter Olympic Games,"My friends and I (in SE Asia) are flabbergasted by all this constant, continual and continuous and very petty, untrue and fabricated stories to harass and  denigrate China.
I must admit that up to a few years ago, we were strong believers of American altruism, exceptionalism and that if anything goes wrong, America would come to our rescue. However over the past few years, the veil was lifted from our eyes and we began to see the evil that the Collective West had been inflicting on us all in the guise of helping us. This constant petulous and puerile denigration of China and Russia is doing more harm than good to the Collective West themselves. Now whenever America looks our way like when the American VP came and said ""We're BACK!""; a shudder of fear went down our collective spines. Whenever Americs looks your way, you know mayhem, destruction, death, displacement, carpet bombing, bio warfare, civilian deaths and displacements will follow. I wonder why the West insist on this proganda platform when it is clearly counter productive. From what we can see, they crested their propaganda  and became the first victims of the falsehood they created. Now there's a saying  of good wishes in South East Asia: ""May America never look your way."""
Headline Buster: Beijing Winter Olympic Games,The West can not stand any success regarding China
