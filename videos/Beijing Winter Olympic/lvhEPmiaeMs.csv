Preparing for the Beijing Winter Olympics: 6 Minute English,"This is BSB reporter. I'm here inside the Beijing Olympics Village. This is the village where American athletes will be staying.  I am here with the Manager of the Village Planner Officer.
Me: Sir, I know you are very busy. May I ask you a few questions. Why are there so many tents in the sidewalk?
The Officer: Oh, thank you very much. We are very proud and we are very happy to have American athletes come and compete here. As you can see, we want them to feel comfortable and make them feel at home. So that they will not miss their homes.
Me: Very nice of you. Chinese people are so thoughtful and very understand of American cultures. Why are there 3 different colors; blue, red, and grey?
The officer: Well, the blue ones are for male athletes and red ones are for female athletes. We ordered them to match the number of US athletes that will come from the US Athlete Commission, no less and no more. You know, we don’t want to waste unnecessary expenses. American initially had decided not to send any of their diplomats. But I was told lately, the US have changed their mind and will send 64 diplomats.  I couldn't find red or blue ones. So those 64 grey tents are for late visa applicants. As you can see, we are also run out of space, so those tents we have to place them near garbage dumps."
Preparing for the Beijing Winter Olympics: 6 Minute English,"""Russia for the crime of doping, is banned from the games that will be hosted by a regime committing genocide.  Let that sink in.  If a ban is a justified punishment for doping what is justified for the genocide and repression of 13,000,000 ethnic minorities in the Uyghur homeland and 7.5 million Hong Kongers?"""
