S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,韩国人是有多自卑啊，暂且不论服饰，中国有56个民族，比如哈萨克族、俄罗斯族等，当然其中也包括朝鲜族，我怎么没见哈萨克和俄罗斯人表达不满呢？
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,"A small country with a national character like the Koreans is very easy to get angry.
In this era when public opinion is manipulated by various NGOs from the United States, The age of social media in which everyone uses corporate America，the anger of the Koreans is very easy to be manipulated.
And this anger will not be directed at their boss, America. Koreans oppose Sadaejuui , believing that it damages their pride and dignity, but I read a lot of Korean articles, and the Sadaejuui that Koreans oppose refers specifically to China. Koreans never write about opposing US manipulation of Korean politics. The Korean Sadaejuui all the time is just a new owner, from China to the United States."
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,It's so funny that the foreign media make things out of nothing.

S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,"I had a genetic test in October last year, and the results showed that I have 27% Korean genes... No one can tell me why❓
My father's ancestry is from Qingdao, Shandong, China, and my mother's ancestry is from Changchun, Jilin Province, Northeast China. It is close to Hunchun City, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin, which borders Russia and Rason City, North Korea. You can see it when you walk in the slightly remote countryside. Old people with curly hair and hanbok. 
The region was free to travel and intermarry with China before the Kim family ruled, and the people of the two countries frequently migrated to avoid war in the early years. But my parents' household registration is Han nationality，and the older generations don’t care about these things‼  

My mother has been making kimchi (and pickling different greens) since I was a child, and our family would dry the steamed soybeans into dry sauce bricks, and then use it to make doenjang, we drink miso soup. In our area, cold noodles are served with shredded dog meat... we never thought it was anything special.
I studied Chinese literature in college, and then I went to Japan to study Japanese literature! Now living in Los Angeles, my biggest hobby is collecting Asian antiques.

The history of conquering Goguryeo was originally told to me by my grandmother as a legend ‼
My grandmother said that she heard from her grandfather that the era of conquering Goguryeo was a cold-weapon war. Not only was medical treatment backward, but the asymmetrical war was fought very violently due to the disparity of troops, so Koreans wearing white clothes after the war were To commemorate those Goguryeo people who died in battle.

There is no hatred between China and South Korea, and there is no hatred between the two peoples! Looking back at Japan 🇯🇵 has repeatedly violated the territory of China and South Korea since ancient times, raped, murdered and robbed people... But now Japan can wear the mask of a humble gentleman, let us eat nuclear food today, and let us drink nuclear water tomorrow, the Fukushima nuclear power plant this year A large amount of nuclear waste water will be discharged into the sea in June ‼

Our two countries are Japan's closest neighbors and the closest to the source of pollution. But the Chinese and Koreans are still fighting on the Internet, and the Japanese pirates may be sitting behind the computer watching these two have been slaughtered by them. The two peoples of humiliation and suffering are in disarray; cabbage, radish, and potatoes fly around ❌ 
The Japanese pirates should have been secretly laughing and fainting! The young people in our two countries seem to have forgotten the national hatred, the family hatred... Instead, they are fighting in groups here~ throwing clothes and smashing cabbage...

More and more I don't know what's arguing on the Internet, a chaotic battle! No one has really explored the truth of history anymore, and netizens are blind and unconfident... The Korean ones are (Hanbok), and the Chinese ones (Hanfu) are different from the literal to the word meaning，OK❓

If we all have time to participate in this kind of irrational and unstructured abuse, we might as well go home and find ancient books to learn. I mean (Korean Chinese characters), not the current (Korean symbols) 
In addition, I think there are people with ulterior motives and countries with ulterior motives on the Internet who are fanning the flames ❌ They are afraid that the world will not be in chaos ❌ It is time for our two countries and their people to face the real existential crisis together... （The name of my tuxedo cat account is TaiChi ☯）"
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,"This is infuriating.  Argentina does the same with many of our traditional food (Paraguay) as does Brasil claiming that TERERE (our traditional drink) is also theirs... People love to claim what is not theirs... China does have its traditional dress , the Hanfu I believe is called, why go for Koreans Hanbok... idiots"
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,"The Four Symbols (Chinese: 四象; pinyin: Sì Xiàng, literally meaning ""four images""), are four mythological creatures appearing among the Chinese constellations along the ecliptic, and viewed as the guardians of the four cardinal directions. These four creatures are also referred to by a variety of other names, including ""Four Guardians"", ""Four Gods"", and ""Four Auspicious Beasts"". They are the Azure Dragon of the East, the Vermilion Bird of the South, the White Tiger of the West, and the Black Tortoise (also called ""Black Warrior"") of the North. Each of the creatures is most closely associated with a cardinal direction and a color, but also additionally represents other aspects, including a season of the year, an emotion, virtue, and one of the Chinese ""five elements"" (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water). Each has been given its own individual traits, origin story and a reason for being. Symbolically, and as part of spiritual and religious belief and meaning, these creatures have been culturally important across countries in the East Asian cultural sphere.

Depictions of mythological creatures clearly ancestral to the modern set of four creatures have been found throughout China. Currently, the oldest known depiction was found in 1987 in a tomb in Xishuipo (西水坡) in Puyang, Henan, which has been dated to approximately 5300 BC. In the tomb, labeled M45, immediately adjacent to the remains of the main occupant to the east and west were found mosaics made of clam shells and bones forming images closely resembling the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, respectively.[1]

The modern standard configuration was settled much later, with variations appearing throughout Chinese history. For example, the Rongcheng Shi manuscript recovered in 1994, which dates to the Warring States Period (ca. 453–221 BCE), gives five directions rather than four and places the animals differently. According to that document, Yu the Great gave directional banners to his people, marked with the following insignia: the north with a bird, the south with a snake, the east with the sun, the west with the moon, and the center with a bear.[2]

In Taoism, the Four Symbols have been assigned human identities and names. The Azure Dragon is named Meng Zhang (孟章), the Vermilion Bird is called Ling Guang (陵光), the White Tiger Jian Bing (監兵), and the Black Tortoise Zhi Ming (執明).

The colours associated with the four creatures can be said to match the colours of soil in the corresponding areas of China: the bluish-grey water-logged soils of the east, the reddish iron-rich soils of the south, the whitish saline soils of the western deserts, the black organic-rich soils of the north, and the yellow soils from the central loess plateau.[3]"
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,"Koreans need to learn china has 56 ethnic groups including Korean, all of them wearing traditional costume to represent themselves not claiming hanbok is chinese though"
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,It is like Germans who get angry when the origin of beer comes from Egypt!!LOL Senseless discussion!! We are all intertwined like Davinchi said once!!
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,Koreans should be happy instead of angry for what China is claiming!! They do it because Korean culture is far more popular and superior to theirs as seen in the recent global popularity!!!
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,I'm Australian EVEN I KNOW HANBOK IS KOREAN .  And is so beautiful when worn by them . Stop faking it China .
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,It's disgusting that large countries try to steal from smaller better country's 💝💝💝💝 #KoreasTheQueenOfTheWorld . This made me subscribe to you . Nice recommendation utube. Ty
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,"Okay guys Han Chinese are ethnic majority in China but there are many other ethnic groups in the country as well.  Han people and culture is Chinese but not all Chinese people are Han. They were trying to represent the different ethnic groups living within China, which include Korean, which explains why there is a woman wearing hanbok. I don't think China is claiming or advertising hanbok as Chinese (Han) but representing the Korean ethnic that's living in China as well as other ethnics as well. So it goes to show that they're probably trying to promote the diversity since China as a whole has more than just one ethnic group and culture."
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,As a Chinese i don't understand why they're doing this. Is so shameful 😞
S. Korea enraged over 'Korean traditional dress' in Beijing Winter Games ceremony,Is there a possibility because there are Korean people in China? I know there are native Korean people as a minority in China. They have Chinese citizenship but has Korean as native language and dress in Korean traditional clothing. But I heard from my roommate that some Korean people don't accept them and dislike them.....
