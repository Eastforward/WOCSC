Shortly before 75 BC, when the Wuhuan of Liaodong revolted, the Western Han drafted delinquent youths and criminal officials from the metropolitan and provincial areas into the army and stationed them in Liaodong. It also relocated Hyeondo Commandery to Liadong (Second Hyeondo Commandery), with the construction of Hyeondo Fortress there to prepare against the invasion of the Wuhuan. As the Second Hyeondo Commandery was located in the area where the Guryeo, the indigenous tribe, resided, the area was named Guryeo County after this tribe and made the ruling place of the commandery. Guryeo was initially treated as a \u201chu,\u201d which was equivalent to a county, by the Western Han, but as the Wuhuan surrendered during the reign of Emperor Huan, it was promoted to a \u201cwang\u201d (principality) that corresponded to a commandery in recognition of its contribution to the victory in 37 BC (second year of Jianzhao) during the reign of Emperor Yuan who succeeded Emperor Huan. This may be the reason why it is recorded in Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms) that Goguryeo was founded in 37 BC. Around this time, the Guryeo was given \u201cGo as their surname from the Western Han and changed their country\u2019s name from Guryeo to Goguryeo, with musicians and performers granted by the emperor in celebration or its elevated status. At this time, the name of Guryeo County in Hyeondo Commandery was also changed to Goguryeo County, which appears in the \u201cTreatise on Geography of the Book of Han that describes the situation of the late Western Han. Then, when Wang Mang, the founder of the Xin Dynasty, tried to subjugate the Xiongnu by mobilizing the people of Goguryeo, it rose up against the policy around 12 AD and became independent outside the boundaries of the Second Hyeondo Commandery. The Later Han Dynasty that succeeded the Xin Dynasty, recognized the title of wang\u201d to maintain relations with the independent Goguryeo, and built a small fortress called Chaekguro Fortress on the eastern border of the Second Hyeondo Commandery where it bestowed o&amp;cial uniforms, clothes and headwears on the people of Goguryeo at special occasions.<br>This is an academic paper material", "textOriginal": "@wang qi e year after destroying Gojoseon, in 107 BC, Emperor Wu of the Western Han Dynasty, established Hyeondo (Xuantu) Commandery (First Hyeondo Commandery) with Okjeo Fortress as its ruling place, and put Okjeo and Yemaek under its jurisdiction. Shortly before 75 BC, when the Wuhuan of Liaodong revolted, the Western Han drafted delinquent youths and criminal officials from the metropolitan and provincial areas into the army and stationed them in Liaodong. It also relocated Hyeondo Commandery to Liadong (Second Hyeondo Commandery), with the construction of Hyeondo Fortress there to prepare against the invasion of the Wuhuan. As the Second Hyeondo Commandery was located in the area where the Guryeo, the indigenous tribe, resided, the area was named Guryeo County after this tribe and made the ruling place of the commandery. Guryeo was initially treated as a \u201chu,\u201d which was equivalent to a county, by the Western Han, but as the Wuhuan surrendered during the reign of Emperor Huan, it was promoted to a \u201cwang\u201d (principality) that corresponded to a commandery in recognition of its contribution to the victory in 37 BC (second year of Jianzhao) during the reign of Emperor Yuan who succeeded Emperor Huan. This may be the reason why it is recorded in Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms) that Goguryeo was founded in 37 BC. Around this time, the Guryeo was given \u201cGo as their surname from the Western Han and changed their country\u2019s name from Guryeo to Goguryeo, with musicians and performers granted by the emperor in celebration or its elevated status. At this time, the name of Guryeo County in Hyeondo Commandery was also changed to Goguryeo County, which appears in the \u201cTreatise on Geography of the Book of Han that describes the situation of the late Western Han. Then, when Wang Mang, the founder of the Xin Dynasty, tried to subjugate the Xiongnu by mobilizing the people of Goguryeo, it rose up against the policy around 12 AD and became independent outside the boundaries of the Second Hyeondo Commandery. The Later Han Dynasty that succeeded the Xin Dynasty, recognized the title of wang\u201d to maintain relations with the independent Goguryeo, and built a small fortress called Chaekguro Fortress on the eastern border of the Second Hyeondo Commandery where it bestowed o&cial uniforms, clothes and headwears on the people of Goguryeo at special occasions.\nThis is an academic paper material", "parentId": "UgynrLhYbMch-kvKgTp4AaABAg", "authorDisplayName": "\uae40\ud558\ub098", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR1iRL22EAOx09DtV_5tRQW7VgvziPIsftr_qJEsijRgg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweptmINgLhcJ3sGw1lfMrw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCweptmINgLhcJ3sGw1lfMrw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-02-07T12:22:27Z", "updatedAt": "2022-02-07T12:22:27Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "QAlkC0j2OiFaGHpS7Zu9Vxn9pS4", "id": "UgynrLhYbMch-kvKgTp4AaABAg.9Y3Nyb9Qygz9Y8lIQCwSnT", "snippet": {"videoId": "tD2DSMH9Wk8", "textDisplay": "@wang qi In general, it is thought that Yein, which spread in the forest area of \u200b\u200bthe eastern part of the Korean Peninsula from the Songhwa River basin to the east of the upper Yoha, developed into Buyeo and Okjeo, and Macin in the west developed into Goguryeo. &#39;Mac&#39; is one of the common names of northern powers that appeared several centuries before the founding of Goguryeo, and gradually became fixed as a term referring to Goguryeo. is not yet visible However, looking at the contents of the tombstone of King Gwanggaeto&#39;s tombstone, it can be assumed that the inhabitants of the village refer to the people of Goguryeo, in other words, from the contents that they were forced to live together with the residents because they were afraid that they might not know the etiquette.\r<br>\r<br>It seems that a population group represented by stone tombs (Jokseokchong) has been formed in the Jib-Hwanin area from around the 3rd century BC, and it is said that it was invaded by Lee Maek when the 1st Hyeondo army was ousted later, where Lee Maek was the Guryeo people, that is, the original Guryeo.
