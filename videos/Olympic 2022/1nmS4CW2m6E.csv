Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,"Doping of Wariewa
""The medicine used by my grandfather is mixed"" explained by a lawyer
The apology is unreasonable
It's impossible for a 15-year-old girl to mistakenly take her grandfather's medicine
The Russian side would have given it to drink as usual to strengthen the players.
To be honest, it doesn't matter whether the drug that reacts with doping is mixed 
in or whether it is intentional or not, and athletes who give a positive reaction at the Olympic selection can participate."
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,"Come on Kamila, we are with you"
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,"Player who violate doping cannot compete in the game.
All  players' efforts and dreams are equally precious."
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,Her parents need to get her out of that country and train somewhere else safer and without scandal. She can still represent her country.
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,"If TMZ ever helped her train with better endurance, all of it effects are null and void given what Kamila Valieva went through before her event in OG. I d say that her training on Olympic ice was diminished to the point that it will have negative consequences on her performance on the day of. I wish her the best!"

Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,Everybody is worried about her and not the real medal owners who had a plenty of dreams? Duh
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,"GOD HIMSELF KISSED THE GIRL KAMILA!  Golden words: Coach Alexander Zhulin accused WADA of the situation with Valieva: ‚ÄúThis is a monstrous injustice.  After all, in order to perform four turns in the air, and even with the grace of Maya Plisetskaya, no microtraces of any drug will ever help.  You can feed tons of this drug to competitive athletes from other countries, but they will not jump quadruple jumps, as it is insanely difficult in terms of coordination.
 It will be a great grief for me to watch in the next four years, and even at this Olympics, the well-fed and satisfied faces of the so-called WADA experts, who caught the poor girl in the ‚Äúterrible‚Äù drug.  A shame!!!
 I think the next step of the genius agency WADA will be aspirin, followed by Coca-Cola and, of course, coffee.  And there, and there is caffeine.  The next step is mountain air, which contributes to increased results.
 An absolutely amazing institution of struggle for fair sport, which very soon, thanks to WADA, will simply be of no interest to anyone.  Welcome to the theater of the absurd!  Very painful and disgusting.
 Not so long ago, in the Broadway show Beauty and the Beast, the main role of the beauty was played by a dark-skinned 100-kilogram pretty girl who said: ‚ÄúBefore, I would not have dreamed of playing the main character, but now in the right tolerant world I can do it  .  Not everything should go to the slender and beautiful ... ‚ÄùThey follow this logic.
 Camila, forgive your parents for your natural beauty and talent, they did not expect you to participate in the celebration of insanity!‚Äù"
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,"When the world gives you a second chance and you dope AGAIN ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Seriously, no more giving into Russia and their influence. Slaps on the wrist won‚Äôt do it for them"
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,"This girl does not need ‚Äúdoping‚Äù! She is a skating miracle! 
She took medication for angina in December! That‚Äôs all."
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,I would hate to see that sweet young person punished for this. I hope they just go after the villains who slipped her the drug.
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,Vladimir Put in official approval for children to be given drugs to enhance their performance. Child exploitation.
Winter Olympics: Russian skater Kamila Valieva to learn Olympics fate after doping hearing,"You cannot accept the fact that 3 of our girls hold all the prizes in the world .... everyone knows who pays these vadas and everyone else, you accuse us of doping, while your women in sports look like pumped mutants. Stop lying to yourself already..."
