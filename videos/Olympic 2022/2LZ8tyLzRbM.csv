What The Chinese Think of The US Boycott of Beijing Olympics and Uyghur Issues | Street Interview,"The opinions expressed in this video are those of individual interviewees alone and do not reflect the views of ASIAN BOSS or the general Chinese population. We tried our best to get balanced perspectives but it wasn't easy. In fact, doing these street interviews in China is super difficult for us because we NEVER ask for permissions from the government and aren‚Äôt registered as journalists. So we hope you guys at least get something out of it. Also check out our street interview on how Taiwanese people feel about China if you haven't already: https://youtu.be/C0YGLDafG1o"

What The Chinese Think of The US Boycott of Beijing Olympics and Uyghur Issues | Street Interview,"Not a single one have anything to say about human rights issue.... apparently human rights issues are ok, but speaking out about it is shameful.     The gaslight is real."
What The Chinese Think of The US Boycott of Beijing Olympics and Uyghur Issues | Street Interview,"This time, I have to give appreciation to Asian Boss for Neutral Journalistic. Thank you so much.

This is also proof that mostly western Mainstream Media are not telling the truth, or sometime they are twisting the fact they receive.
I am also Chinese overseas, and believe most Chinese Mainland people are happy and their quality life is better and better. 
This is because of the work of Chinese Communist Party. 
Look how great the comments of those people in the street in Shanghai, showing the quality of their education and manner. 

For those who are still believe that communist regime are always bad, then you have to realize that you are consuming too much Western Mainstream Media or your own government are not capable what China doing right now.
The narrative of bad China, bad communist are coming from the point of view Western Media and politician who work based on popularity contest, not capability contest. 

We all human being, and I believe mostly people are good, the mostly problem in this world in many country is uncapable Politician (evil) and Media. 
So, I hope Asian Boss could be the solution for better quality media, not working as provocative media who work just for money amd creating polarization and disintegration. East and West should work together."
What The Chinese Think of The US Boycott of Beijing Olympics and Uyghur Issues | Street Interview,"I suggest you guys interview people who live in small cities, instead of citizens in Shanghai or Beijing who can afford their expensive spending.  The pink hair can afford 4K$ jeans, while many of others can only earn 4K¬•(630$) a month

Obviously, they are satisfied about the Chinese society, because they can always have a happy day though they lack of freedom"
