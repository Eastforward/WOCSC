"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)",Basically organise for a delay on a minor's samples and you're good to go.
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","So we are looking at 3 different endurance substance found on her samples 🙃🙃🙃.  Even if 2 out of 3 substances are not banned, then isn't it still doping?  If that side stresses that Kamila is a minor, she shouldn't be competing at WOMEN'S SINGLES SKATING and instead be retained at junior division, should she?"
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","They are Russian, they live in a country with little opportunities, most are poor. They just dope and lie for a payout …its all bribes and corruption its heavily embedded in Russian life. Its a normal way they cheat to win. And show no remorse."
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","What the Americans and Western Europeans will not come up with to take away the well-deserved medals from Russian athletes. They even go to falsification and substitution of doping samples. At the same time, Western and American athletes use doping and steroids in packs."
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","Another Colin Powell test tube. As usual, American and Western European liars replaced the sample of the Russian athlete. American and European athletes, pumped up with doping, steroids, cannot compete honestly
The American press and sports officials use double standards in the case of a positive doping test of Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva and similar cases with athletes from the United States.
This was written in a material for the sports portal 3 Wire by American journalist Alan Abrahamson, who specializes in covering the Olympic Games.
In particular, he recalled that about six years ago, American gymnast Kristin Sheldibin passed a positive doping test, in which an extremely low content of a banned diuretic was recorded. It was stated that the substance got into her body with tap water, which she drank from the tap without cleaning. 

""Then American officials blamed - as in the case of Kamila Valieva's breakdown – the whole system for what happened? No,"" Abrahamson noted, recalling that Sheldibin was not punished in any way and performed at the OI.
The journalist also noted that since 2016, at least 25 anti-doping investigations have been identified in the United States, after which no punishments were applied to athletes, and moreover, it was not claimed that ""the anti-doping system is under threat."" Norwegian asthmatics who stamp medals in bundles turn out to be absolutely ""clean"" in terms of taking medications
By the way, do you happen to know why meldonium is not banned in the NHL, for which Russian athletes were punished? I explain: there is no Russian national team in the NHL. They won't, for example, punish the St. Louis Blues hockey players for meldonium, it's not the Russian national team"
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","The whole grandfather/drinking glass BS is more or less identical to the tennis player Mariano Puerto who reached the French Oprn 2005 final, lost to Nadal and immediately tested positive for a banned cardiac drug also. He appealed claiming claiming he had accidentally ingested trace amounts of it from his wifes wine glass, as his wife was on this medication for high blood pressure supposedly. Kamila and Co must have been reading from his playbook 😂😂😂🙄🙄"
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","American journalist Alan Abrahamson accused his compatriots of a biased approach to the case of Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva.
""Almost six years ago, American gymnast Kristin Sheldibin passed a positive doping test. An extremely low content of a banned diuretic was found in it. It turned out that the substance got into her body with tap water, which she drank directly from the tap. Did American officials then blame the whole system, as they did in the case of Kamila Talieva's breakdown? No,"" Abrahamson wrote and added that no punishment was imposed on the athlete, and she performed at the Olympic Games.
In the text, he noted that since 2016, at least 25 anti-dumping investigations have been recorded in the United States, which ended without punishment"""
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","Christine Brennan thinks that Russia should be banned from the next two Olympics, 2024 Summer Games and 2026 Winter Games.  She also thinks Russia needs to be banned from the next few FS world championships as an extra measure. Brennan says in her interviews that she believes this evolving scandal may just be the big thing that finally makes the IOC ban Russia.  Russia would need nothing short of catastrophic ban across the board in order to finally stop their sanctioned doping practices."
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","I don't really understand why everyone is so mad, to be honest. The investigation has not been completed yet, so it is not known whether Valieva is guilty or not. These analyses and legal issues will be dealt with over the next months and only then will we know the truth. Valieva should take part in the competition, and if she is found guilty, the medals will be awarded to other prize-winners. If she is not guilty, then the reward will rightfully remain with her. In my opinion, it is absurd not to allow Kamila to participate in the Olympics when the investigation has not been completed."
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)",Putting Russia in charge of Russia. What could go wrong :)
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)",We all know that the other Russian skaters are doping! Can someone tell me why you would dope in skating and what they are doping and using for it? I am interested! What can you dope that is important in figure skating?
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","""How did this substance magically fly into her system?""  Best skating quote ever!  ;)."
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","Thank you for all the updates! You are doing such a fantastic and important job these days. We can trust your words,  cause they come from an interest and love for the sport. So, thank you for your hard work!!"
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","speaking of hiring a Russian orthodox priest for a Muslim girl and not observing COVID protocols, Valieva testing positive for covid would almost be the best solution to this chaos at this point"
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)",It would be great to see a stand of solidarity for clean sport in the ladies event. They should each leave a test sample and hair sample in the kiss and cry to show they believe you should be clean to compete.
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","Her results were clean for the  Olympic game. And, it should be investigation in place why December 2021 testing has brought the results with considerable delay.  In any case Kamila is the best and no one can perform better."
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)","Kamila is surely a brilliant Talent, they should give Her a 2️⃣. Chance...Best wishes from 🇩🇪💪🏽🙆🏼‍♀️👌🏼👌🏼👍🏻👌🏼⛸️⛸️"
"As The Blade Turns: The Outcome (Kamila Valieva Doping Case, 2022 Olympic Games)",The IOC should Hold the team medal ceremony and give the medals to America and Japan those Athletes should have their moment. ROC should have to wait till the case is resolved. When the case is resolved if Kamila is found guilty then the US and Japan can get bumped and Canada can get bronze. That is the fairest way to handle this. Everyone seems to be forgetting that evidence ie positive test...is not proof it is evidence. Guilt can only be assigned AFTER a trial.
