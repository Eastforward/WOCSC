"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance","HOW DARE THEY???  Take it up with the IOC, but DO NOT ATTACK A 15 YEAR OLD GIRL!!!!"
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",Screw these haters. Her performance was great.
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",'have a hard neck'
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance","Where all of you were at the last Olympics When Simone biles had the same issue and she was called a hero. Double standards, why? Because when US is wrong nobody thinks it’s bad but when is the enemy of US is all it’s horrible. This is all BS."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance","Let her compete… everyone should be able to medicate or treat whatever they need to treat, it’s not an easy sport there are a bunch of health risks. Sometimes the rules are ridged for a reason, but sometimes we have to take a look at the rules and see if that is priority over someone’s health. I don’t have full context but I can tell this is drama. And I think everyone should be able to compete. No matter what they are on. Does this give them an unfair competitive advantage… you be the judge of that… of course they can still have regulations but it’s not like she was on something bad. Maybe the substance can impair them, that’s on the person who decides to take it or the persons who requires it."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",Good luck young lady but your name will always be associated with doping. Nothing new for Russian athletes.
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",Why can't therr be a ceremony for the real winners and kick her out?
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance","If a microdose of a med taken several weeks ago were still producing some kind of ""advantage"", wouldn't it still be in her system? Yet all her tests since then have been clean. There's more to this story, and judgment should be withheld."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",Why Simona Biles crap at the Olympics because the evil Japanese forbade her to drink magic pills?
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance","There is so much hate and angry comments here, it breaks my heart. People rush to post hurtful words without understanding the bigger picture and why Kamila was allowed to compete and what it means. Kamila had a micro-dose in her December 25, 2021 test. All of her other tests, before and after that day were clean, including her test at the Europeans in January 2022 and the Olympics in February 2022. In such cases, even adult athletes, who knowingly took forbidden substance, at most get one month suspension.  This is exactly what the US runner got when tested positive for a banned substance - 1 month suspension. If this was the case, Kamila's suspension would have been over on January 24, and she still would have been allowed to compete at the Olympics. The lab, purposely or accidentally, held up the test results for nearly 2 months instead of 10 days, blaming it on Covid, and thus violating Kamila's right to due process and taking away her opportunity to respond. Keep in mind that the same lab has successfully processed her and other athletes' later tests on time.  What if Kamila was banned from competing at the Olympics and it turned out that there was a lab error or a conspiracy? She would have suffered an irreparable harm as this could be her one and only chance to compete at the Olympics.  That is why she was allowed to compete.  I am sure there will be further investigation and if she is indeed found guilty, there will be consequences. However, if she is not guilty, she would have her fair chance.  And Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, as official commentators, should do their homework and attempt to understand what is really going on before casting their uneducated, judgemental, and narrow-minded comments over national TV, influencing our viewers.  They sound mean, dumb  and simply unprofessional."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",NBC! Please fire Weir and Lipinski! They are such unprofessional hypocrites! No one takes their comments seriously anymore.
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance","She is a disgrace to the sport ,true Olympic athletes ate pure and accept glory or defeat as long as they are pure and unlike you use drugs"
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",..there isn't a pill in the world that can make you skate as well as this girl does...i blame the chinese.
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance","What matters most is if she is under physician’s care for treatment of a heart condition. Sounds she like could have an arrhythmia, mitral valve prolapse (or both) or or dysautonomia with postural hypotension or tachycardia. Many tall thin teens have these. She was so good at figure skating at such a young age it’s hard to imagine any need to use performance enhancing drugs. The meds she was accused of only last hours in our systems. They are not like anabolic steroids which last months. Watch her skate at 5 years old. She was amazing even at that young age."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance","The American press and sports officials use double standards in the case of the positive doping test of Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva and similar cases with athletes from the United States. This was written in a material for the 3 Wire Sports portal by American journalist Alan Abrahamson, who specializes in covering the Olympics. In particular, he recalled that about six years ago, American gymnast Kristin Sheldibin passed a positive doping test, in which an extremely low content of a banned diuretic was recorded. It was stated that the substance got into her body with tap water, which she drank from the tap, without cleaning.
""American officials then blamed – as they did in the case of Kamila Valieva's breakdown – the whole system for what happened? No,"" Abrahamson noted, recalling that Sheldibin was not punished in any way and she performed at the OI. The journalist also pointed out that since 2016, at least 25 anti-doping investigations have been identified in the United States, after which no punishments were applied to athletes, and moreover it was not claimed that ""the anti-doping system is under threat."" Probably for an ""exceptional nation""....THIS IS DIFFERENT"
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",this is bad for the sport and the russians really should be disqualified from competing. The excuses dont cut it anymore.  We have seen this repeated behaviour and the cheating had been going on since the 60s  How many clean athletes were denied medals due to this illegal behaviour?Disgusting
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance","These two decided to take the American anti-Russian position on this. But that wasn't enough for them. They continued to dig the knife in this girl's back for what seemed like FOREVER-- throughout not just her skate but also the warmup. Hopefully for the free program these two narcissists will pipe it down and let us enjoy this ""once-in-a-lifetime"" ""simply exquisite"" skater's performance. It's interesting to see how the Russians respond to Weir who adores Russian culture and wants to fit in with them so much. They should disown him for his cowardly betrayal."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",Boooooooo to her. I hope she's ok. But definitely booo. She must be booing herself.
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski's quiet anger during Kamila Valieva's controversial performance",Why is no one posting full routines?  Is that on hold till the investigation is over too?  I wanna see Papadakis & Cizeron win.
