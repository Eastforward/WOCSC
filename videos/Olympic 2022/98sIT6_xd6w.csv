Highlights from the Olympics,"I pray for human rights of Chinese people. No more massacres No more dictators No more tortures No more deceivings No more brainwashing No more cheating, lying and etc......

I wish peace and love on China with democracies someday. and also freedom on Hongkong, Tiwan, Tibet and so on. 

Long time ago China was great I heard. But there's no such country anymore. Who made China the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now? I hope the government born again this time. Bc I know many good people there

God save China üôè"
