BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"Doping of Wariewa
""The medicine used by my grandfather is mixed"" explained by a lawyer
The apology is unreasonable
It's impossible for a 15-year-old girl to mistakenly take her grandfather's medicine
The Russian side would have given it to drink as usual to strengthen the players.
To be honest, it doesn't matter whether the drug that reacts with doping is mixed 
in or whether it is intentional or not, and athletes who give a positive reaction at the Olympic selection can participate."
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"This is absolutely a performance-enhancing drug, my response is long but it‚Äôs the medical facts of why she has an unfair advantage. This topic has really upset me because I don‚Äôt think the general population understands what an unfair advantage this medicine gave to Kamila Valieva. And she is not an innocent victim she knew what she was taking. When you are involved at this level and athletic competition you are aware of everything that you take. She is not some na√Øve child. Think about the responsibility of driving a car and then the United States 15-year-olds get their driving permit. Both my son and daughter were in athletics that drug test and they would not take anything that would provide any cause of concern that it was an illegal substance. They both understood the consequences even at 15. Neither would take anything unless they knew exactly what the medicine was for and why they needed to take the medicine. If I tried to sneak it to them and said it was a vitamin, and my son never fatigued at football practice that day, he would not stupid enough to believe it‚Äôs just a vitamin. I assure you Kamila Valieva is no na√Øve child in this situation.

I‚Äôm a cardiovascular intensive care registered nurse so the second thing that I am furious about is most people do not understand the action of the drug this skater took called Trimetazidine. Reporters are calling it a ‚Äúheart medication‚Äù. That does not sound all so bad until you know the physiology effect Trimetazidine has on your body. It is way more than just an average heart medication. It is made for people with end-stage heart failure in attempts to keep them alive until they can get a heart donor. Trimetazidine effects a person‚Äôs cardiac output (CO) and stoke volume (SV) or ejection fraction (EF). This is very complicated topic I will try to provide a very layperson answer but I will attach a link if you were interested in reading more. This medication is targets the bottom two heart chambers called ventricles and meant for patients whose ventricles are not functioning well enough to sustain life. The left ventricle is most important as it pumps the freshly oxygenated blood out to the entire body with each heart beat. A person with end-stage heart failure needs to be on medication like Kamila Valieva was taking to increase oxygenated blood pumped to her body ( increasing CO and SV/EF) Most skaters start to have extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, exhausted, and their legs start cramping or feel like Jell-O because with that high intensity activity their heart cannot increase cardiac output and ejection fraction enough to compensate for the oxygen demand. Remembering, the only way their muscles are getting oxygen is  circulating blood. This is why jumps and spins are bonus points after halfway through their program when they are most tired. Kamila Valieva is obviously a very talented skater, but without taking Trimetazidine she would get tired and fatigued like all the other skaters and has a higher chance of falls if she chose to continue quads after the midpoint of her program. 

A normal cardiac output for a healthy 15 year old is 5-6 liters, Meaning their heart is able to pump 5 to 6 L of blood throughout their entire body and return for reacts generation each minute. And that is at rest, pretty amazing huh! The ejection fraction measures how much blood in the ventricle actually gets pumped out during each heartbeat. The more powerful the beat the more blood it pushes out. Remember your heart is a muscle so the stronger the muscle the more blood it can clear from a chamber. 
Ejection fraction is the percentage of blood volume ejected in each cardiac cycle and is a representation of LV systolic performance. It is calculated from the end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes of the left ventricle. The formula for calculating EF is:
EF = (EDV-ESV)/EDV
               
In a typical 15 year old at rest the EF is 60 to 100 mL of blood leaving the ventricles with each heartbeat. Competitive athletes need more oxygenated rich blood leaving the ventricles to keep up with the demands of oxygen to their legs, lungs, and other muscles to sustain the amount of activity involved in jumps and spins in skating. An idea stoke volume can be obtained using Fick‚Äôs principle and the formula is In equation form: CO = VO2/ (a ‚Äì v O2 difference) where VO2 represents oxygen use by tissue and a-V O2 is the difference in oxygen content of arterial and venous blood. Remember a normal health 15 year old pumps 5-6 liters of oxygenated blood every minute versus an elite Olympic athlete or skater has a cardiac output of 35 liters of oxygenated blood circulating every minute!! Enormous difference of 6 L per minute versus 35 L per minute. There is no way a person that has a cardiac output of 6 L per minute could hope to compete with someone with a cardiac output of 35 L per minute. So imagine when Trimetazidine is taken by a healthy Kamila Valieva how high her cardiac output increases, We need those elite athletes with the 35 L per minute but cannot match the stamina Kamila Valieva has to do the late program quads. There is only a certain amount of conditioning an athlete can do it unfortunately anything else is achieved by doping. There is a great chart that shows the oxygen demand on different body systems while at rest and high activity. http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/exercise/img/co_organs.gif during strenuous exercises such as Olympic skating you would not be surprised that skeleton muscles sky rocket above anything else in demand for oxygen. Hopefully you can now understand why the medication she took is so unfair and is cheating. She does not deserve the gold medal by cheating and getting way more oxygen via her cardiac output because of the medication allowing her to do her incredible stunts.

BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,Disgusting state sponsored cheaters .. IOC is so corrupt .. Russia should be banned from the Olympics..
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,russia has still not learnt from its previous state sponsored doping scandals!!
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"Russia was given a chance after MASSIVE cheating in Sochi - clearly nothing has changed.  Time to ban them indefinitely.  They shouldn't get to ruin yet another Olympics.  And whoever gave Valieva this BANNED substance should no longer be allowed in any sport, or around any children, EVER again."
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,Just disgusted! No Russian can be trusted. I‚Äôm finished with the Olympics!!! Boo her off the ice! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"According to the CAS, athletes under 16 like Valieva have more rights 
under anti-doping rules and typically aren‚Äôt held responsible for taking
 banned substances. The focus of any future investigation will home in 
on her personal team - coaches, doctors, nutritionists, etc.   ‚ÄúThe 
panel considered that preventing the athlete to compete at the Olympic 
Games would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances,‚Äù CAS 
Director General Matthieu Reeb said.
‚ÄúThis appears to be another chapter in the systematic and pervasive disregard for clean sport by Russia,‚Äù US Olympic and Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland said in a statement.
Minors have more rights ?   The Russians will now use this decision in the future for all their athletes under 16."
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,If she was disqualified the US would have won. I wonder where these accusations come from???
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"DOPE, DOPE DOPE !!!! Russians are famous for it but any ways they can compete."
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,America does not know what kind of dirty trick to do to Russia
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"And this is one of why I am not watching the olympics- along with the despicable CCP, you got the Russian cheaters being allowed to compete.

What a joke."
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"no need to rejoice that she is taking part in the competition‚Ä¶ 15 years old and doped, she will keep this reputation forever.  What will happen to her in competition in the future?  what do its Russian competitors, who respect the laws of competition, think?  that she won the Russian championship by cheating?  Poor child, this competition is only the beginning of the problems and for those around him too.  Only his youth saved him, she was not whitewashed, allowed to participate and that is the truth and that is what the world will remember."
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,Russian Hucksterism at its best. Nice try Putin Lackeys.
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"Someone should tell her that despite her dumb dream, that she is still a child not an adult"
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"OI OI OI !!! The people that are talking about her better shut the fuck up unless its good shit, cuz I have a knife. She's the victim here and she's such a loveball, such a sweetheart, people better not fucking forget that !"
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,Everything in Vlad's Russia is a lie.
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,"Pushing drugs onto Russian athletes is approved, and even encouraged, by the Kremlin. Has been for many years. Putin is perfectly aware it is going on. These young girls have a very short sports career and are burnt out, physically and mentally, by the time they are 18. They are put under enormous psychological pressure to perform and win. Valieva‚Äôs coach already has younger girls ready to replace her. It is basically a racket in child exploitation."
BREAKING: Russian official says Olympic skater Valieva not suspended,WADA... What corrupted regulators.
