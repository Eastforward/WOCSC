This topic has really upset me because I don\u2019t think the general population understands what an unfair advantage this medicine gave to Kamila Valieva. And she is not an innocent victim she knew what she was taking. When you are involved at this level and athletic competition you are aware of everything that you take. She is not some na\u00efve child. Think about the responsibility of driving a car and then the United States 15-year-olds get their driving permit. Both my son and daughter were in athletics that drug test and they would not take anything that would provide any cause of concern that it was an illegal substance. They both understood the consequences even at 15. Neither would take anything unless they knew exactly what the medicine was for and why they needed to take the medicine. If I tried to sneak it to them and said it was a vitamin, and my son never fatigued at football practice that day, he would not stupid enough to believe it\u2019s just a vitamin. I assure you Kamila Valieva is no na\u00efve child in this situation.<br><br>I\u2019m a cardiovascular intensive care registered nurse so the second thing that I am furious about is most people do not understand the action of the drug this skater took called Trimetazidine. Reporters are calling it a \u201cheart medication\u201d. That does not sound all so bad until you know the physiology effect Trimetazidine has on your body. It is way more than just an average heart medication. It is made for people with end-stage heart failure in attempts to keep them alive until they can get a heart donor. Trimetazidine effects a person\u2019s cardiac output (CO) and stoke volume (SV) or ejection fraction (EF). This is very complicated topic I will try to provide a very layperson answer but I will attach a link if you were interested in reading more. This medication is targets the bottom two heart chambers called ventricles and meant for patients whose ventricles are not functioning well enough to sustain life. The left ventricle is most important as it pumps the freshly oxygenated blood out to the entire body with each heart beat. A person with end-stage heart failure needs to be on medication like Kamila Valieva was taking to increase oxygenated blood pumped to her body ( increasing CO and SV/EF) Most skaters start to have extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, exhausted, and their legs start cramping or feel like Jell-O because with that high intensity activity their heart cannot increase cardiac output and ejection fraction enough to compensate for the oxygen demand. Remembering, the only way their muscles are getting oxygen is  circulating blood. This is why jumps and spins are bonus points after halfway through their program when they are most tired. Kamila Valieva is obviously a very talented skater, but without taking Trimetazidine she would get tired and fatigued like all the other skaters and has a higher chance of falls if she chose to continue quads after the midpoint of her program. <br><br>A normal cardiac output for a healthy 15 year old is 5-6 liters, Meaning their heart is able to pump 5 to 6 L of blood throughout their entire body and return for reacts generation each minute. And that is at rest, pretty amazing huh! The ejection fraction measures how much blood in the ventricle actually gets pumped out during each heartbeat. The more powerful the beat the more blood it pushes out. Remember your heart is a muscle so the stronger the muscle the more blood it can clear from a chamber. <br>Ejection fraction is the percentage of blood volume ejected in each cardiac cycle and is a representation of LV systolic performance. It is calculated from the end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes of the left ventricle. The formula for calculating EF is:<br>EF = (EDV-ESV)/EDV<br>               <br>In a typical 15 year old at rest the EF is 60 to 100 mL of blood leaving the ventricles with each heartbeat. Competitive athletes need more oxygenated rich blood leaving the ventricles to keep up with the demands of oxygen to their legs, lungs, and other muscles to sustain the amount of activity involved in jumps and spins in skating. An idea stoke volume can be obtained using Fick\u2019s principle and the formula is In equation form: CO = VO2/ (a \u2013 v O2 difference) where VO2 represents oxygen use by tissue and a-V O2 is the difference in oxygen content of arterial and venous blood. Remember a normal health 15 year old pumps 5-6 liters of oxygenated blood every minute versus an elite Olympic athlete or skater has a cardiac output of 35 liters of oxygenated blood circulating every minute!! Enormous difference of 6 L per minute versus 35 L per minute. There is no way a person that has a cardiac output of 6 L per minute could hope to compete with someone with a cardiac output of 35 L per minute. So imagine when Trimetazidine is taken by a healthy Kamila Valieva how high her cardiac output increases, We need those elite athletes with the 35 L per minute but cannot match the stamina Kamila Valieva has to do the late program quads. There is only a certain amount of conditioning an athlete can do it unfortunately anything else is achieved by doping. There is a great chart that shows the oxygen demand on different body systems while at rest and high activity. <a href=\"http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/exercise/img/co_organs.gif\">http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/exercise/img/co_organs.gif</a> during strenuous exercises such as Olympic skating you would not be surprised that skeleton muscles sky rocket above anything else in demand for oxygen.
