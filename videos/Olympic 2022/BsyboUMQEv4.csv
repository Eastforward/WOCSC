This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),"Jonathan and Sandra just *vibing* as artists I love it. Sandra's comments connecting the Valieva scandal to SLC were very illuminating. Fans have been screaming about the corruption in scoring for years and get gaslit by people in the sport. When is the sport going to admit there's a problem?

I was so happy to see H/D skate so well and win a medal. You have to just fall in love with their skating whenever they have a half-decent program. A few errors but I guess that's part of just going for it the way they did. They deserve to be remembered as a great team."

This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),Sandra bezic is an honest woman ..... and we all need more honest people in our lives!

This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),"This was a great recap!  I really enjoyed such a positive show about a really good dance event. I thought it was refreshing to see commentators speak more bluntly. I thought Scott Moir was a standout ‚Äî not only did we get some of those blunt comments that gave us a few chuckles, but I also really learned something about how to look at ice dance from his comments about the Italians‚Äô knee bend or the program composition of Vicky and Nicky and that whacky Riverdance section."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),dr shvetsky was lurking around at the dance event too. no words lol
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),"""Their last minute should have taken them off of the podium."" Love Sandra."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),Watching Sandra watching Dave getting all breathy and imitating her! I love it!
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),"I still think Chalk and Bates had the best free skate by far and should have been on the podium. They are undoubtedly the most creative ice dance couple with the most dance ability, flow and connection on the ice."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),Seeing you both with Sandra is the best thing that's happened in the last two days. Thank you!!!
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),"Dear TSL, thank you so very much, for keeping the world informed.

Sandra, you are a joy, so insightful and knowledgeable, thank you for your thoughts and grounding us.

Re: Doping - I'm not going to mention Valieva specifically here, because I do not believe for one moment that she is the only skater from Russia affected by abuse or controlled Doping. But consider this - instead if having ""protected persons"" due to being minors, change the minimum age of competitors to exclude minors, i.e. raise the minimum age of competitors to prevent this type of farce in future.   These children are exactly that - CHILDREN. They are being abused by doping, damage to their bodies, broken bones, delayed puberty, poor nutrition and dehydration.   That's one thing for a Survivalist on exercise (not the doping obviously) but they're adults who have trained and prepared for the rigours of survival expedition and come to that place as an adult making an informed decision.

TLDR: change minimum age to prevent minors (protected persons) competing, thus ensuring athletes are responsible participants.

P&C - RD was the most sublime dance I've ever seen.

S&K - the RD didn't have anything remotely related to HipHop, and literally no choreography.   The FD was blasphemy to music. Boring and forgettable.

H&D - I was so impressed by both programs,  and that lift!! OMG.

C&D - RD wasn't anything special.  The FD has grown on me as the season has progressed.  If I had watched it for the first time at the Olympics, I wouldn't have understood it.

S&D - phenomenal.  Just phenomenal. 

Fear/Gibson- RD was good.  FD - they missed a trick. Vogue would have been such an Olympic moment,  but Lion King didn't hold my attention.  Not that it was bad, it wasn't, but Madonna would have been phenomenal.

Hawayek/Baker - My favourite US team.  When will they be marked appropriately? They are always so under-scored.

Guinard/Fabri - The RD was cheesy, but I did love the lift where she struck the MJ poses.   He always appears too small for her, and I'm always amazed at their lifts."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),"‚Ä¶you‚Äôd have to think that if the USA presses charges against Eteri or anyone else involved, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to step foot in the US or any country with an  extradition treaty with the US. That‚Äôs a considerable number of countries where competitions could be held."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),Scandal in 1972 was Trixi Schuba winning with a boring poor long program because of her lead in figures therefore women who could really skate such as Janet Lynn ( fall or no fall) and Karen Magnussen didn‚Äôt stand a chance. Therefore I believe the next year the ISU  brought in the short program
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),"My 2 moments in for this event were also S/D and P/C. That Zorro program is going to be a guilty pleasure that I'll go back and watch over and over again. Yes it's cheesy, but I'm just such a sucker for that. For P/C, I didn't love their FD all season but for some reason in Beijing there was a sudden moment of clarity in their FD where everything clicked for me. When I need a good cry I'll be going back to the P/C FD again.

Totally agreed about the IAM skaters: each of them are presented in the best way possible drawing on all of their own unique strengths and none of them look like the other teams. That in itself is an incredible feat. Much love and respect for this school in Montreal!"
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),You guys are amazing!! Thank you for giving us some fair but clear words of truth these days!!

This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),"Thank you for this Dave and Jonathan. As a long time figure skating fan,  the decision to allow Valieva to skate was a huge blow to clean sport and I just feel gutted. It was so refreshing to hear Sandra‚Äôs take on the recent events. 
While I heavily considered not watching the Women‚Äôs SP earlier today, I ended up watching and not sure why I bothered since I was left feeling angry on how it played out."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Ice Dance Recap with Sandra Bezic (Papadakis and Cizeron),"I am glad that all of you are getting profits, I mean money, from the tragedy of a fifteen years old."
