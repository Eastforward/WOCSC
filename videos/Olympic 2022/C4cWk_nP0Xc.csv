Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Russian skater in the deadlock after doping scandal confirmed | WION,"Take back the medal! She is a cheater! Russia has been doping athletes for 40 years! They weren't even allowed to compete for a few years because they broke into the testing facility to try and change the results.
  They knew that they could never win legitimately, so they chose to use drugs and hide the positive drug tests. 
Google it.
Losers!"

Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Russian skater in the deadlock after doping scandal confirmed | WION,"_As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, ‚ÄúTell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?‚Äù And Jesus answered them, _*_‚ÄúSee that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ‚ÄòI am the Christ,‚Äô and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. ‚ÄúThen they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name‚Äôs sake. And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come._*_ Matthew 24:3‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨14_

*_‚ÄúBut when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near._*_ Luke 21:20_
*_‚ÄúSo when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place,(...)_*_ Matthew 24:15_
_Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation. And by smooth words he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will be strong and take action. Daniel 11:31‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨32_
 _And from the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. Daniel 12:11_
 *_(...)then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short._*_ Matthew 24:16-22_

*_‚ÄúImmediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other._*_ Matthew 24:29‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨31_

*_Because you have kept the word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that hour which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth. I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, so that no one will take your crown._*_ Revelation 3:10-11_

_But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as indeed the rest of mankind do, who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose from the dead, so also God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus. For we say this to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17_

*_‚ÄúBut concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming._*_ Matthew 24:36‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨42_

_Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking, following after their own lusts, and saying, ‚ÄúWhere is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation.‚Äù 2 Peter 3:3-4_

*_‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.‚Äù_*_ John 3:16-21_

Repent now of all your sins (get away from all sins) and abide in the Savior and Lord Jesus the Christ (Yeshua the Messiah) with all your heart, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Russian skater in the deadlock after doping scandal confirmed | WION,"China should first focus more on its toilet problem and feeding its 200 million starving people rather than trying so hard to host a poor failed corona Olympics like this ü§£

# That was early Jan 2021. Few months later in April, India nearly collapsed under the massive second wave. So instead of their brags of saving other countries, she cried desperately for help from others to  save her!"
