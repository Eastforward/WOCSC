Team USA enters Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony 2022,请有点职业操守， 中国人民没有人权，到处受到集权打压，经济马上崩溃，自然环境恶劣不利人类生存，百姓贫困潦倒，对了还有新疆棉问题，最后那个女火炬手肯定不是新疆人。 报道中没有这些内容，怎能让西方大众接受呢？   美国都说了抵制了，这些运动员肯定是中国政府冒充的， 请重新编写报告！

Team USA enters Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony 2022,"The beauty that appeared at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics is fake. Hanbok, kimchi, samulnori, and yutnori, which were introduced as Chinese beauty, belong to Korea. China's act of stealing Korean culture and distorting Korea's identity and history is disgusting. Please don't be fooled by Chinese lies.😢😢"

So show here more Korea's tradition and then iit will prove that China is serving Korea. Thank you so guys"
