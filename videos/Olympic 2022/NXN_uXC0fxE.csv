Hearing for 15-year-old Olympic Russian figure skater after drug scandal,Isn't this the same thing that Sha'carri Richardson was banned for? How could this be? üá∫üá≤
Hearing for 15-year-old Olympic Russian figure skater after drug scandal,"I will write this comment everywhere, maybe then people will think, and they will not take on faith everything that the propaganda media says without hesitation:
And how do Americans, all so honest, who are for honest sports, feel about the fact that their athletes drink drugs, saying that a doctor prescribed it to them? But wait, legal or not, you drink drugs that make you stronger and you win, but WADA says it's all right, it's legal. Is it fair to other athletes who come out already knowing that you took drugs and they won't beat you? No, it's as unfair as doing it covertly, but you keep doing it and it's no less depressing for your opponents. You are talking about honesty and fairness, but are you honest yourself after the whole world learned last year that many athletes from the US and other countries are taking drugs that are banned by WADA? After the sanctions of Japan last year, Biles showed a poor result, without her drugs, refused to continue, she proved by this that they helped her to take high places. Let's take all her medals, just like everyone who drinks drugs, even if it's for health. It will be honest and fair if the sick will perform in the Paralympic sport, and not with healthy ones))) And it‚Äôs too cunningly they came up with someone who has a migraine, she drinks medicine for migraine, but it increases her physical data. Is it fair? No. In such rules there is no honesty and integrity. I won't be surprised if all countries have their own laboratories that make new drugs that are not on the WADA list. I'm sure. Why, before Sochi, Russians were not caught so often on drugs, and after Sochi, Russians all decide to actively drink them? This is strange, very strange. I wonder which country will be the culprit of such scandals next? Which country will stand in the way of the United States to medals ... if the world still remains as it is now?)))))
I read an interesting comment from Steve here: ""If she is exempt from being accused of doping because she is minor, she should not be allowed to compete because she is minor."" I wrote about ""patients"" who drink drugs, so I want to paraphrase Steve's statement: ""If patients are exempt from doping charges because they are sick, they should not be allowed to compete because they are sick."" Fair enough? Honestly? It is necessary to take all the medals from S. Biles, asthmatics from Norwegians, and other ""sick"" athletes from the USA and other countries)))))If you have written the rules, then follow them, or do not write anything at all, openly say that the USA is an exceptional nation, and it allows drugs to those who obey them. Hypocrites"
Hearing for 15-year-old Olympic Russian figure skater after drug scandal,"Whats her name, Richardson? The track runner who was booted because of THC? How do Kamila get a free pass for a performance enhancing drug and Richardson got booted for a drug that was legal in her home state is was probed for decades claiming that drugs including marijuana can so call once said, fry your brain? The Committee fucked up big on this decision! It hasn't even been a year since Richardson got booted. Did they think this was forgotten?!"

Hearing for 15-year-old Olympic Russian figure skater after drug scandal,"Recall Sergei Grinkov, who won 2 Olympics and died due to a heart attack when wearing skates at the age of 28. About a quarter of myocardial infarctions happen without specific premonitory symptoms. While therapeutic use of prohibited substances is possible - why is disease prevention forbidden?.. I don't say that the prohibition was intentionally violated - I say that the prohibition to prevent severe diseases is unethical. Each organism is unique and may need personalized aproach to disease prevention and treatment."
