US Olympic Pair Team Ashley Cain-Gribble & Timothy LeDuc practice their 2022 Free Skate (July '21),I normally don’t like free skate music but this is a good score 👍 nice program too
US Olympic Pair Team Ashley Cain-Gribble & Timothy LeDuc practice their 2022 Free Skate (July '21),"Excellent choreography but no passion and feeling in this. Way too clinical. I prefer Oona and Cage Brown, So full of passion and in tune with each other on a base level. Don't get me wrong, mountains of skill and accuracy, attention to detail but oh so clinical. Doesn't feel quite right to me."
