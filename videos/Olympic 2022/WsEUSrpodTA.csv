The Zhu Yi Olympic Figure Skater Fiasco Explained,What are your thoughts on Zhu Yi?
The Zhu Yi Olympic Figure Skater Fiasco Explained,This is false regarding Eileen Gu. There‚Äôs no record of her relinquishing her U.S. citizenship and she refuses to answer such questions. Highly doubtful she gave up her U.S. citizenship. There would be a record of this.
The Zhu Yi Olympic Figure Skater Fiasco Explained,"I bet she's regretting giving up her citizenship , Eileen Gu should be banned from entering the U.S , let her stay in China"
The Zhu Yi Olympic Figure Skater Fiasco Explained,"Long arm of capitalism tripped her up ü§£ü§£ü§£ this is karma and it‚Äôs what she gets. Have fun working in a sweat shop because you failed your communist regime, traitor. If she ever comes back to the states she should face the same consequences as people who defect during wartime. Softness to traitors will destroy us all."
The Zhu Yi Olympic Figure Skater Fiasco Explained,So when the Russian team lose their team medal and China inherit the bronze are they are going to refuse it as they don‚Äôt agree with the team selection? I doubt it.

The Zhu Yi Olympic Figure Skater Fiasco Explained,"Chinese don‚Äôt like her because we are not sure if she got selected because of her competency or because she got a rich dad. If someone got selected because of this, there will a poor girl who prepared for years, but didn‚Äôt got selected. You can‚Äôt  read the comments in Chinese. You just think we only adore the ppl who can win. It was not the case. We appreciate all the athletes. We just don‚Äôt like favoritism."

The Zhu Yi Olympic Figure Skater Fiasco Explained,"I am a Chinese person and I was stunned after watching this video. In the age of information technology, I can still blow it like this!
The whole network in China cares about, helps, and understands her, and there are only a few people with rhythm!
In addition, regarding the nationality of her and Gu, although I don't know the real situation, it is for ordinary people that China does not allow dual nationality. If you are very powerful, you can go to any country at will. This is called freedom of nationality.
Moreover, they are both from elite families, and the elites look farther. Why did their parents go to the United States in the first place? Why go back to China now? There is an old Chinese saying: People go to high places."
