"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","Katelyn won the gold in 2018. She, Yuna and all the other chested girls deserve better than ISU and IOC corruption. Med and Zag were on the regimen too"
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating",Hey USA how about focusing on closing your borders then worrying about Ukraine.
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","Those who defend Valieva as a victim because she is young are also liars.
Valieva is a tainted adult who dares to lie blatantly when the evidence is clear.
Valieva is the beneficiary, not the victim. For doping, Valieva won medals that should have been given to other athletes, and gained fame and fortune.
The real victims are honest athletes who practiced quad jumps without resorting to vile means to compete with drug users like Valieva, and then gave up on Olympic Games or even sacrificed their careers due to injuries.

It would be a blatant lie to claim that the drug was detected in Valieva's doping test because of her grandfather.
What came out of Valieva's doping test wasn't just the heart drugs used for doping.
A diuretic used to excrete various drugs to destroy evidence of doping has also emerged
In other words, the detection of heart drugs is only the tip of the iceberg.
Russia has developed special techniques to keep their athletes free from doping tests, and Valieva only got caught by mistake."
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating",I feel like this issue will be just ignored like what happened to sochi.
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating",Kamila was tested clean before games. What's a problem now? Why she called her unclean?
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating",Kamila‚Ä¶ We are with you angel üíôüß°üíöüíú‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüß°üíöüíú
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","She has three teammates with the same coach, so it is impossible for her to deliberately use doping, she opens a new era, she should not be smeared"
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","What a talanted 15yo figure skater. Enjoying her performances. Her case is very complicated. 1) The sample was from december, and it took 45 days to announce the results while the normal period is 20 days. It showed just A TRACE of microdose of the drug. A TRACE! 2) All other samples are clean. 3) She seem not need any drug and medicine. She is young and strong, also it is not an athletic. People love her for the artiscism. ... Also the commete should do their job not pressuring her (without media, without announces), because it is dificult to imagine what damage to her psyche can apply. But despite all of the pressure she showed the highest scores."
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating",Athlete who violates doping cannot compete in the game. This principle must be observed without exception. All players efforts and dreams are equally precious.
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","If the skaters are not clean, they should not be allowed to skate.  The Olympics should  be on an even scale.  Not skating clean breaks the trust I  the system.  Everyone should have the rules app.ied equally"
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","Off topic, but is this woman related to the Osmond family (ie Donny and Marie)?"
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating",keep excusing the cheats and you'll keep getting these scandals every other Olympiad
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating",Especially if you consider that Karolyn ‚Äòs  main opposition were also from the same training rink as Valieva and whose is to know that there were not performance enhancing drugs in the ‚Äúvitamins‚Äù that competitors from that rink have admitted to been given
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","I really appreciate a more unbiased opinion on this situation. I imagine it would be difficult to remain calm when you've been through the same competitions. The fact is as the public we don't have a good deal of information. While Kamila is most certainly old enough to understand the wrongness of doping I do think the number one concern is her health. I think we forget that athletes are people. Even if the situation ends up putting her clearly as guilty down the road, I would be concerned about her mental health first and foremost."
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","Wow, really impressed by Kaetlyn.  She seems to be very genuine and heartfelt in her answers.  Witty too."
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating",She‚Äôs being way too nice!
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","I don't want to see a quad in women's figure skating. I miss the days of Yuna, Osmond, Mao, and Karolina."
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","Whether intentional or not with the drug, the Drug is in her blood regardless that ""helped"" her Win Unfairly.  No Drug, she probably would have gotten Silver, Bronze Fairly...or no metal!!?"
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","If she respected the sport she would have withdrawn from the compitition, its as simpla as that."
"Kaetlyn Osmond on Kamila Valieva, her testing stories, and how the saga affects Olympics & skating","Not only Kamila, but the entire Russian team shouldn't be allowed to skate. They are supposed to be banned aren't they?! Banning a piece of cloth, in your county's flag accomp!ishes nothing. As for Kamila being 15 yrs old, that is not an excuse to give her a pass, she's old enough to know what the deal is and the testing. Tara Lipinski was 15 when she won gold and she knew, she said she wouldn't even eat a poppyseed bagel! I also believe the scoring is being skewed here as well now. That even needs to be scrutinized as well. There were skaters that skated beautiful clean programs after her  that should've scored higher.than Kamils b/c her skate was far from perfect."
