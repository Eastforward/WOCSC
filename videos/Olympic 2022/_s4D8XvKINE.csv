What about the aboriginals that were slaughtered and forced into residential schools and up to now a lot of aboriginals are still gone missing and that was what I heard from an aboriginal. I mean these guys have no rights to talk about human rights if they were doing the same. Only the country who was clean and never violated human rights has the right to say this.

"Canada joins US, UK & Australia in diplomatic boycott of Beijing Olympics| 2022 Winter Olympics News","Trudeau let be clear of one thing, Mr. Wang Wenbin (Spokesperson of Foreign Ministry CHINA) had made it very clear in one of the press conferences that YOU ARE NOT EVEN INVITED to witness the Beijing Winter Olympics Grand Opening Ceremony on 4th Feb 2022 

It was not your call to attend or to boycott. YOU ARE NOT EVEN INVITED & HOW CAN YOU ATTEND? 
Nobody wants you to be there, same goes to USA, Australia & UK.
ALL OF YOU WERE NOT INVITED."
"Canada joins US, UK & Australia in diplomatic boycott of Beijing Olympics| 2022 Winter Olympics News","I will not be watching.   The Olympics is a global showcase for America-hating, unngrateful US athletes but don't dare whisper any criticism of China's totalitarian dictatorship.
Yang Shu, the deputy director of international relations for the Beijing organizing committee, said any speech against the Olympic spirit or Chinese laws would be ""subject to certain punishment"" during a press conference on Jan. 18. 
If the FBI, Pelosi and other politicians are worried about how our athletes will be treated by this disgusting government of control freaks, why are we sending them there?   Just like tracing the origin of Covid-19, follow the money.  Why would the IOC choose to honor the country that gave us a global pandemic, that is guilty of ethnic genocide, that represses religious freedom, that raped and disappeared a star athlete, that censors the internet, that erased the Tiananmen Square massacre from history, that invaded Hong Kong and threatens Taiwan? Why? Follow the money.
Shortly after Beijing won the 2022 bid, Gian Franco Kasper, then the head of the International Skiing Federation and an honorary IOC member, told a Swiss newspaper that the choice of Beijing made perfect sense. ""Dictators can organize events such as this without asking the people's permission,"" Kasper said. ""For us, everything is easier in dictatorships.""
Boycott China"
