Who impressed Alexandra Trusova? UNLUCKY OLYMPIC TRIXEL #beijing2022 #ice #iceskating,"‚ö°Ô∏èThe talent of the Russian rocket is admired far beyond the borders of our country.  Sasha has attracted the attention of world famous people more than once.
 Alexandra Trusova is a phenomenal girl whose fame goes far beyond figure skating.  Even popular musicians and Hollywood stars bow before her quadruple jumps and talent!  The figure skater, who defeated gravity and launched the women's single into space, attracts the attention of the most sophisticated public.
 Yes, and how else?  After all, she is a personality with a capital letter.  A person who follows his own special path in big-time sports and finds a lively response and support from others.

 In her first adult season, Alexandra Trusova performed in a free program in the image of the main character of the Game of Thrones series, Daenerys Targaryen.  Sasha reincarnated on ice as the mistress of dragons.  The Russian rocket, which the fans already then tacitly dubbed the ""queen of quads"", this role fit perfectly.  But Trusova still tried to understand as much as possible how and what to skate about, so she not only watched several seasons of the series, but also read John Martin's book A Song of Ice and Fire, which formed the basis of the screen story.
 Sasha's efforts were not in vain: she turned out to be an ideal mistress.  Only not dragons, but quadruple jumps with which she skated to the Game of Thrones soundtrack - Pray (High Valyrian).  This song was written by the leader of the famous British rock band Muse Matt Bellamy.  Tense music with heroic notes successfully accompanied the dizzying jumps of the figure skater and helped from the first seconds to set the audience to watch an exciting rental.
 Under this track, Trusova won her first adult Grand Prix stage - Skate Canada and immediately set two world records: in the free program and in the sum of both programs.  Then Sasha landed three of the four quads, two of which were in a cascade.  It was an incredible achievement, and it did not go unnoticed by Matt Bellamy himself.
 The musician saw a video of Sasha's performance to his song and admired the brave Russian figure skater conquering quadruple jumps.  In honor of her victory, he published a separate post on his Instagram.

 ‚ÄúCongratulations to Alexandra Trusova on winning the Skate Canada with three quads.  And thanks to her for using Pray (High Valyrian) as the soundtrack,"" wrote Bellamy.
 But quite a lot of figure skaters skated to the songs of the Muse group, but it was Sasha who received such attention and personal congratulations from a rock star!

 Alexandra, of course, was flattered by the attention of Matt Bellamy, but, being a fan of the Game of Thrones, she really wanted the actress who played Daenerys, Emilia Clarke, to also appreciate her free program.  To fulfill this desire, she recorded a video message for her idol, which was then posted on the official Instagram page of the Olympic channel.

 ""Hi, Emilia Clarke.  We have a message for you from Alexandra Trusova,"" the caption says.
 ‚ÄúI want the actress who plays Daenerys to write to me somewhere.  Or I would like to meet her, ‚ÄùTrusova said.
 Sasha's meeting with Emilia Clarke did not take place.  Whether the actress wrote to her is unknown.  But at least Emilia noticed her, although she is not interested in figure skating.  In any case, messages surfaced on American forums that Emilia saw Sasha's rental and liked it, and she also conveyed greetings to the athlete on her own behalf.

 Another Hollywood star who was impressed by the skating of Alexandra Trusova is the legendary actress Sharon Stone.  In February last year, she reposted in her stories a video with a fragment of Sasha's demonstration number to the song Game of Survival performed by Ruelle.  She spotted this video on the instagram page the.figureskatingworld.  On it, the skater performs her signature element - the cantilever.  Sharon was so impressed by this trick on the ice that she could not resist and shared it with her.

 And it can be understood: anyone who has ever seen Sasha making a cantilever will agree that she is an unsurpassed master in it.  Among girls, sure. And among the guys, few will be able to challenge her in this matter.  And if he does, he will most likely lose.  The Russian rocket is second to none.  Especially the strong sex.

 In the Olympic season, Alexandra Trusova again skates in a free program to the soundtrack from a famous film.  This time the choice fell on Cruella.  On the ice, the figure skater appears as the insidious main character, played in the film itself by the inimitable Emma Stone.  According to Sasha, she would like to meet this actress and, perhaps, ask her how best to convey the image of Cruella.
 However, Trusova does an excellent job without any advice.  But it will be great if Emma Stone watches the performance of our ""queen of quads"" and leaves her star review."
Who impressed Alexandra Trusova? UNLUCKY OLYMPIC TRIXEL #beijing2022 #ice #iceskating,"I watched Sasha's short program last night. There was a split second in the middle of the routing where the camera did a closeup shot of her face, and she smiled directly at it while still staying in character as she was skating.
I could see how happy she was to be at the Olympics and most of all how much she was loving it out on the ice. Whether she medals or not, Sasha will still be known as a legend and pioneer in jumping for women's skating."

Who impressed Alexandra Trusova? UNLUCKY OLYMPIC TRIXEL #beijing2022 #ice #iceskating,"I feel so bad for Trusova. She along with the other two members, Anna Scherbakova and Alena Kostornaya, truly revolutionized ladies figure skating but their contributions have been ignored in favor of Valieva. I am
Not fully convinced that Valieva had not been offered enhancement drugs, prior to the Olympics!  And even her record breaking performances should be looked upon as suspect!"
