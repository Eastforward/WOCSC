This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"I have no desire to watch ""doped"" athletes compete against ""clean"" athletes - what's the point!"
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"If it was an American, the athlete would be done. The coaches would be done. The parents would be done.  Heck. Look at the HUGE debate over the positive test for weed (not much of a performance enhancing drug and if anything it is a depressant and would not be advantageous to consume before being asked to run any race let alone a 100 meter dash) before Tokyo for Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson! But the US said ‚Äúnope, we said it‚Äôs not allowed so you‚Äôre not going.‚Äù Could you imagine Russia saying the same? Ha. That‚Äôs a joke."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"When it comes to if Kamila was ok with doping to be a star like Zhenya, I doubt she even knew she was taking them. Eteri always refers to the pill cocktails she gives the girls as ""vitamins"" (even saying as one thing gets banned they'll find something else to give them because ""the girls need their vitamins""), she may have just believed thats what they were, not banned substances that could be bad for her.

Johnny and Tara, I don't blame them for what they say. There's very clearly things they are told to say and things told not to say. Including praise for nearly any skater other than Nathan till the free (and then only for ones that wouldn't be a threat to medal), because NBC has this whole narrative built around him to pull in viewers. Like if you compare their commentary to 2018, they used to be funnier, but also had a lot more to say about each skate- including a lot more nice comments about the skaters themselves and their performance. Both times Johnny spoke about Jason and how good he is, it felt like he was going off script, those were things he wasn't supposed to say. It felt like not just giving him the praise he deserves but a moment of solidarity- because he went through the same thing the ISU and USFSA are doing to him. But the way they really had Tara talk about ""the struggles Nathan faced"" in the last 4 years, after his privileged ass said what he did about LGBTQA dominating the sport (really? With this homophobic ISU keeping everyone in the closet??? Really???) and he was the poor straight boy trying to make it masculine, when he has been getting all these inflated scores (they really gave his very obvious baxel from the short a +4 goe how is that a real score) and his failure at 2018 was just him not skating well  and not the federation or the ISU being against him. And saying he struggled like that while sitting right next to Johnny, who actually did have to fight through all kinds of bullshit basically his whole career. It's clear they have teleprompters and cue cards telling them what to say. And they're not going to let them speak against Eteri, because the ISU doesn't want that. (Why I think Johnny is saying minimal about the situation on twitter even, because if he speaks against her he's done for regardless of how much he actually knows about how those girls are treated.)

Those death threats from fanyus were proven to not be true???? There were very few english comments on his posts at all, and most unhappy comments were to do with him not doing well at the team event. People fully made that up on twitter, where it spread to reddit, and then back to twitter and people took it as true. I love listening to you guys, and like most of the video, but that's not cool. And I'm not a Yuzuru shooter being defensive or anything, I'm a Jason girl, and I saw all that unfold on twitter and no one having an actual source for it, and actually bothering to checking his instagram. Yeah he has a lot of fans, and fanyus can be nuts, but it's not cool to blame an entire fanbase on something maybe one or two did. I was seeing everything go down as the event happened, no one was really blaming him, or anyone, even though the hole was big enough he put half his hand in it. I saw what were very clearly jokes about checking Nathan's locker for a hammer, but again, jokes. 

He has the fans he does for a reason, you know, they're not just nuts for him because he's pretty, or engages with them on social media or anything. He has these fans because he's really good. And not just at jumps, but actual skating, edges, transitions, all of it. So why are people that are his fans people that know nothing? Meanwhile people coming on tweets about Yuzuru's 4A posting videos of that short program baxel going yeah well can he do this, Nathan won suck it, but when people point out it's a god awful Axel they say people are being mean because they don't know anything about it and thought it looked cool, and they like him just because he's American. People who literally know nothing. 

""Didn't help his team"" Yeah because the JSF has it out for him for forever (He had the nerve to beat Disuke at 2014, the president's fave, and she's never forgave him for that), and they DIDN'T EVEN ASK HIM TO DO THE TEAM EVENT. It's not that he refused, they didn't want him, they wanted Shoma and Yuma. Something that hurt him, fyi, he mentioned in an interview he would have loved to do the Team event again. Again, what's with spreading misinformation? It's like you guys hate him or something? 

-Also Yuzu *did* land it in practice, he showed Nobu (I think it was him? Or one of the reporters) a video of it. And the 4A was certified, if not ratified, it was scored as a A4 not downgraded to a 3A. He had fucked his ankle during that practice session before, and couldn't feel his right foot during the free.

Surprised that you didn't mention Donovan, first time a Mexican skater has made it to the free skate in the Olympics, coming from a mall rink, he did so good in my opinion, such a good skate for him. Hopefully this is going to be a push for him to get better training facilities, he can really go places and I can't wait to see where he'll be in a few years.

My best moment was when I had the podium from my deepest and unlikely fantasies, Yuzu, Jason, and Junhwan. I got just a taste of that being reality and I appreciated that."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,You guys are hilarious and on point lol
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,If you watch the congratulatory video from USFS for Nathan‚Äôs win I think Evan Lysacek‚Äôs advice really hit it spot on (and you guys touched on it too)‚Äî on how rare it is for an OG medalist to really enjoy such a moment when they are under so much pressure. My heart is so full for Nathan!! I hope he keeps skating!!
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,i too love roman sadowsky.  i have felt that what he needs is a change of venue.  he needs i think to skate in a rink where he is not the best skater. i don't know what other quads he has besides the toe and sal but it's his nerves that seen to do him in. he needs to build confidence in himself and i don't think he will get that where he is training.  i am surprised the canadian federation hasn't suggested something altho maybe they have. it is so sad what happened to him. i hope skate canada doesn't write him off.
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"With Hanyu's stamina, I don't think he would be able to handle team event so it was best he didn't do it. Also, I don't think outcome would be different."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"Thanks for this fantastic video! I was so excited to see that Zagorodniuk was a guest! I remember watching him as a child and loving his skating and always feeling that he was under-marked and under-appreciated! By the way, Jonathan is actually correct: the pronunciation is ""MelDOnium"" and not ""meldoNIum."""
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"In other sports, entire teams get disqualified if one member tests positive. That's why Usain Bolt lost his Olympic gold from the Beijing 4x100m when Nesta Carter failed a test. If that pattern was followed, every event would need to be rescored without the ROC."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"Jonathan, Nathan cited Massimo Scali working with him since November and addressing the musical details and other nuances.  Also showing what he was feeling during the skates.  See Phil Hersh's excellent article, dated either 2/11 or 2/12/22.  Also very lovely: Raf supported Scali's work and presence."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,I don't believe Hanyu blamed the hole on the ice for the 4S failure.  He only talked about it but was accepting that it was likely from a toe jump so couldn't blame anyone but only his bad luck.
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,Yuma‚Äôs dad had a beautiful 3A and that wonderful knee bend! A high jumper üëå
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"Since Scali collaborated w/Nathan (@Nathan‚Äôs request) and won, I wonder if Alysa‚Äôs dad is wondering about his decision to have Alysa abruptly leave Scali ü§î"
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"Second comment on this video<  I really enjoyed all skaters, I was hoping none would have a mistake, all were wonderfull , with their own performances, challenges, etc. I really enjoy it, of course was really sad seeing Yuzuru fighting this hard for his program, been alone, I really do not agree with Brian excuse of Yuzu wanted to be alone, I desagree on this, it looket like I am with you when you win not when you loose.
I totally happiness with Shoma Uno and Yuma skating, really happy to see bouth there on the podium, specially Shoma who has ween my skating heart since 2016..
And now would hope to see must of this skaters at worlds, please let it happend."
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,Nathan was the Olympic moment we all needed. Seeing him just be there and enjoy it and the confidence‚Ä¶.he is so so trained and so talented and he knew he could and would do it. Yuzuru didn‚Äôt give him the run for his money that was possible but also just realized he would have had it in the bag regardless. So proud of him.
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,"I did see Jason Brown‚Äôs short program and free skate on the NBC Sports Channel, but for some reason they were taken down. üò¢"
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,How exciting to see Viacheslav! Wasn‚Äôt expecting that treat.
This and That: 2022 Olympic Games Men's Recap with Viacheslav Zagorodniuk & Kamila Valieva Doping,Thanks for all your great videos. I have been spending lots of time watching them all so I call you guys my best buds when I talk to my husband about TSL and ATBT.
