China: US-born Olympic star Eileen Gu wins big air gold for China in Beijing,China needs to give her automatic citizenship!
China: US-born Olympic star Eileen Gu wins big air gold for China in Beijing,Two faced traitor
China: US-born Olympic star Eileen Gu wins big air gold for China in Beijing,"Eileen Gu  is still  the US citizen 
She never been given up her US citizenship 

According to communist  Chinese law 
Dual citizenship  is not acceptable 
To represending  the chinese  Olympic  team    her nationality  status  must be chinese citizenship  only"
China: US-born Olympic star Eileen Gu wins big air gold for China in Beijing,"She is strong girl, as she punched back the question even harder when she felt that was insulting and disgraceful. The only thing she can not do anything about is the jealousy from people even from the us mainstream medias. Like she said that it is their lost. She got picked all because she represents China."
China: US-born Olympic star Eileen Gu wins big air gold for China in Beijing,"For Gu Ailing's critics and haters..I want to sayÔºöWhy are you hatred with the American people?Do you know that the United States is an immigrant country? Immigration is a large part of American society, and Immigration is one of the important reasons for the vitality, development and strength of the United States, They were not born and raised in the United States. They came from all over the world to build a great America,And you call them ""traitors"". That's ironic ! I don't know why the United States becomes more and more confident, The US once gave the impression of being confident, tolerant and sunny, But today it has become sensitive, suspicious, hateful and full of gloomy negative energy,  Freedom, openness and tolerance are values that the United States has long advocated, those who are the key to the success of the United States, and today the United States is abandoning them,  This is dangerous for a society whose main population structure is multi-ethnic,If governments and politicians can't do the right thingÔºåMutual understanding and solidarity will no longer exist,  Contradictions and differences will intensify and society will fall into internal strife . Everything that America's ancestors built up hard is being torn down by their descendantsÔºåAmerica is in big trouble."
