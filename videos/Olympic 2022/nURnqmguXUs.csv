Opening ceremonies kick off 2022 Winter Olympic Games,"I think the boycutt is quite good. Olympic only need athletes , less political people means less chances to spread the covid virus to other country, i would prefer to refuse the visa for those politics first countries, they are not the main actors for this show, who cares they will come or not, don't be ridiculous. Athletes will not lose this chance for the Olympic once in 4 years, it can bring honor to themselves forever their life, no one will remember any  athletes who didn't attend the Olympic due to politics in history, you missed then you missed, no matter you are used to the champion or not. If those countries extremely prefer to put polices first, then those government should give no prize to the champions when they come back. You can't control people's freedom to join, but you can insist that is dirty metal from no human rights country and put subject on news ' shame on you ', i strongly support Biden and Morrison government to do that, prove what you said and you guys will win the next election, can't wait to put my vote now."
Opening ceremonies kick off 2022 Winter Olympic Games,"You can’t boycott something you weren’t invited to lol. Also it’s a huge joke for imperial colonizers to not address their own human rights violations while pointing the finger at other countries who their threatened by. As if America isn’t the biggest human rights violators. Rampant wealth disparity, voter suppression, not taking covid seriously, all of the wars, lack of clean drinking water in many places, no care for homelessness, the prisons are for profit private businesses that thrive on keeping people of color locked up, literal slavery is still legal here with prison labor, the fucking class traitor cops, no corporate accountability for climate control, omg I could go on and on. America needs to take care of its own people before pointing at another country, when we are our own and the world’s biggest enemy.

It’s really hypocritical to say “free Tibet and Hong Kong” when America is built on stolen land and has colonized Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, US virgin island, bikini atoll, the Philippines, and more with no apology or care. America is shitty to our indigenous people and we even let the fucking nazis come live here as refugees while we deny literal Mexicans from coming here for a better life. 
America fails us in education and most people here don’t really understand history besides what America wants us to think. We’ve had concentration camps here so many times, so many “ethnic cleansings”, lynchings, and cops who are gang members. Is despicable. 
As an American, I’m so angry at my country and America has to fix ourself first before we act like we ever cared about human rights."
Opening ceremonies kick off 2022 Winter Olympic Games,"Wtf is with that introduction? No one talks about how the Japan olympics tried to keep a new covid variant hush hush as it spread from Olympian to Olympian, and back to their respective countries. Meanwhile trying to keep covid contained is a human rights violation? Wtf?"

Opening ceremonies kick off 2022 Winter Olympic Games,"It’s racism to think only people in certain countries are capable of living a happy life solely under certain political system. They sanction China for not following that model but these countries never ask the opinions or consensus from the majority in China. Obviously, they have decided for China and its people that the western-style democracy is the only righteous way to live or we will bring down your government and make you suffer."
