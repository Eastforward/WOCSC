Also it\u2019s a huge joke for imperial colonizers to not address their own human rights violations while pointing the finger at other countries who their threatened by. As if America isn\u2019t the biggest human rights violators. Rampant wealth disparity, voter suppression, not taking covid seriously, all of the wars, lack of clean drinking water in many places, no care for homelessness, the prisons are for profit private businesses that thrive on keeping people of color locked up, literal slavery is still legal here with prison labor, the fucking class traitor cops, no corporate accountability for climate control, omg I could go on and on. America needs to take care of its own people before pointing at another country, when we are our own and the world\u2019s biggest enemy.\n\nIt\u2019s really hypocritical to say \u201cfree Tibet and Hong Kong\u201d when America is built on stolen land and has colonized Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, US virgin island, bikini atoll, the Philippines, and more with no apology or care. America is shitty to our indigenous people and we even let the fucking nazis come live here as refugees while we deny literal Mexicans from coming here for a better life. \nAmerica fails us in education and most people here don\u2019t really understand history besides what America wants us to think. We\u2019ve had concentration camps here so many times, so many \u201cethnic cleansings\u201d, lynchings, and cops who are gang members. Is despicable. \nAs an American, I\u2019m so angry at my country and America has to fix ourself first before we act like we ever cared about human rights.", "authorDisplayName": "Belle Zhao", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS1lO7y6-YOlckRC68EOnvmG0tofpcJiZEVXbWDMQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCArSjkLq_l1klcT5ue_8HVQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCArSjkLq_l1klcT5ue_8HVQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-02-10T18:21:58Z", "updatedAt": "2022-02-10T18:21:58Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "lgbUrAvuvYZYzg4WkQqekuSv1Hs", "id": "Ugyfqj0DOP6w1BBXbVd4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "nURnqmguXUs", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "GAJVrbwwZelFwQgAah8-zpeuxA4", "id": "Ugyfqj0DOP6w1BBXbVd4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "nURnqmguXUs", "textDisplay": "Wtf is with that introduction?
