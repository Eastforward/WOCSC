Is There More To It? Belgian's Olympic Quarantine Meltdown | Beijing 2022,"What major bullshit comment. She was positive the first days of january., missed out 2 worldcups to entirely recovery and test negatieve as the rules request. Otherwise she would never have been able to get on  the plane to Bejing as the restrictions are very strict
As you know. Â´spend some time Â´ with your girlfriend Â´ is not a goal for an olympian, training years for this event.!! Assuming this post is made for Â´manipulatingÂ´ is only possible fir people who donÂ´t understand the emotionele rollercoaster of this girl.  
Besides this it was NOT mentioned in the guidelines. There was mentioned that after 2 neg tests within at least 24 h , they are released . 
Not to mention that there was a recovery document, the bloodsamples prooving her antibodies, no whatsoever symptoms and neg testing. 
Kim is the most honest human being. Stop assuming she is a manipulating piece of shit!
She was very happy, excited and full of positivity towards this games!!"
Is There More To It? Belgian's Olympic Quarantine Meltdown | Beijing 2022,Maybe she didnt know she was suppose to supply her own food in quarantine. They should have been informed.
Is There More To It? Belgian's Olympic Quarantine Meltdown | Beijing 2022,"The village is awesome and high tech, there are robots everywhere, the rooms are nice, everything is nice and clean, food and laundry is free!!! What is there to compain about?? Many people in China don't have any food to eat and live in total misery and you complain about food been the same? Madam, you are having a very good life..be grateful for what you have! I wish my room was as nice as the one you have and with free house keeper to clean up after my room. The korean restaurant in the village has free food, tell someone to get food from them to give you or maybe if someone brings you food from a super market you can cook them in your room? Sorry, that place is not a palace. Don't expect every place you go to be a palace! You can get the virus without wearing masks and if you kiss people in the face and they kiss you! Now, concentrate on getting better so you can compete in a few weeks and don't think about all the bad things around you, many things are nice in there!"
