Revealed: A true account of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"Showing the costumes of the ethnic groups in the opening event is deceiving the World. Why? China recently banned the language educations of the ethnic groups at schools for their young generations. It includes Uyghur, Mongolian, Tibetan and Korean. China now treats the groups as enemies under Xi. At least, China disrespects them. Nationalism dominates there."
Revealed: A true account of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,I totally agree with you. Thank you for this video.
Revealed: A true account of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"It's interesting American companies are supporting China hosted Olympics. I just sold all my stock in all of them. The Chinese have threatened a war, faced with Natural Disaters, Economic chaos, Business Relocations, Food Shortages, Building Crisis, Stock Market Downgrades, Energy Crisis and world scruntny of the brutal concentration camps. The innocent people forced into these camps face gang rape, organ harvesting, forced sterilization, forced hard labor and many other crimes against humanity.
I think God is behind China's decline!"
Revealed: A true account of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"BIDEN (et ses alliés) est déclaré Persona Non Grata aux JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022. Les pays participants du boycott diplomatique sont marginalisés. Ils se comptent avec les doigts d'une main. Une trentaine de Chefs d'Etat et de Gouvernement sont présents à la Tribune des JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022. Poutine en est la vedette. Sont présents à la Tribune: le Secrétaire Général des Nations Unies, le Grand Duc Henri du Luxembourg, le Prince Albert II de Monaco, le Président de la Pologne et le Président de la Serbie. Aux JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022 la Chine et la Russie s'affichent ensemble pour montrer le nouvel ordre mondial. Sans BIDEN. La Russie a reçu le soutien de la Chine en ce qui concerne les préoccupations raisonnables de la Russie. La Russie et la Chine s'opposent à l'expansion future de l'OTAN. L'occident doit empêcher l'humoriste d'Ukraine d'allumer le feu de la troisième guerre mondiale. Un ouïghour porte la flamme olympique pour dénoncer les tissus de mensonge occidentaux sur les ouïghours. Un coup de pied au cul des journalistes des télévisions menteuses occidentales. Une paire de gifles aux députés français votant la résolution sur les ouïghours.-

BIDEN (and his allies) is declared Persona Non Grata at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The countries participating in the diplomatic boycott are marginalized. They can be counted with the fingers of one hand. About thirty Heads of State and Government are present at the Tribune of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Putin is the star. Present at the Tribune are: Secretary-General of the United Nations, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Prince Albert II of Monaco, the President of Poland and the President of Serbia. At the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, China and Russia are coming together to show the new world order. Without BIDEN. Russia has received China's support regarding Russia's reasonable concerns. Russia and China oppose NATO's future expansion. The West must prevent the comedian from Ukraine from lighting the fire of World War III. A Uyghur carries the Olympic flame to denounce Western fabrics of lies about Uighurs. A kick in the ass of Western lying TV journalists. A pair of slaps to French MPs voting for the resolution on the Uyghurs.!!"

Revealed: A true account of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"I think since we are going to a different country we should play by their rules, so participants that have train so hard in what ever the sport that they are, should be told they can't compete 2 minutes before the start of their competition. They should be told that they cant compete cuz their country political views are not making sense. And just like that that athlete that represents that polital view of their country wether or not agrees with their country's political view would not compete."

Revealed: A true account of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"All with Chinese tax dollars, which the people have no say. All factories are shut down since winter 2020, just to give an unpolluted sky that we Beijinger call the “Olympic blue”. While Olympian is building their “career” for two weeks, Chinese people had to suffer through their regime for a life time.  Thank you foreign propaganda."
Revealed: A true account of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"Clearly slanted story. I will not be watching.   The Olympics is a global showcase for America-hating, unngrateful US athletes but don't dare whisper any criticism of China's totalitarian dictatorship.
Yang Shu, the deputy director of international relations for the Beijing organizing committee, said any speech against the Olympic spirit or Chinese laws would be ""subject to certain punishment"" during a press conference on Jan. 18. 
If the FBI, Pelosi and other politicians are worried about how our athletes will be treated by this disgusting government of control freaks, why are we sending them there?   Just like tracing the origin of Covid-19, follow the money.  Why would the IOC choose to honor the country that gave us a global pandemic, that is guilty of ethnic genocide, that represses religious freedom, that raped and disappeared a star athlete, that censors the internet, that erased the Tiananmen Square massacre from history, that invaded Hong Kong and threatens Taiwan? Why? Follow the money.
Shortly after Beijing won the 2022 bid, Gian Franco Kasper, then the head of the International Skiing Federation and an honorary IOC member, told a Swiss newspaper that the choice of Beijing made perfect sense. ""Dictators can organize events such as this without asking the people's permission,"" Kasper said. ""For us, everything is easier in dictatorships.""

Revealed: A true account of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,It is a shame that some politicians are shamelessly criticising about human rights in China but actually their own countries' human rights are jokes.
