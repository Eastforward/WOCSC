10 Records that could be broken at Beijing 2022!,"Hahaha If I was Chinese, I wouldn't have commented on the Winter Olympics. Most Chinese already know that the way to win a gold medal in this Olympics is selfish and very dirty. They try to foul first and then pull out a strong competitor. And if they foul, the judges will not judge it No. This Winter Olympics feels like watching the classic Japanese game Downtown Nekketsu Koushinkyoku"

Especially on short tracks
if you touch a Chinese, you're penalty

唯一新中國在冬奧2022年（Winter Olympics games 2022）在北京如火如荼日烈成功舉行：

三民主義、三位一體（天地人）、社會主義新中國，例如：

（1）民權（更快、更高、更遠）。

（2）民有（自由式、璇轉式、穏定性）。

（3）民生（金牌、銀牌、銅牌）。

總而言之，天上人間、天人合一，大道之行、天下為公，世界大同、世界和平，世紀文明、天下一統，社禝幸甚、國家幸甚，切蹉共勉，阿彌陀佛 。"
