Lifeguard at the Olympics - the world's easiest job? 🤣,"This is bad optics for the Olympics to post. Lifeguards are an integral part of the Olympics. As a lifeguard (Bronze Med, Bronze Cross, CPR-B, CPR-C & NL Pool) I’m hurt that they would say it’s an easy job. If the unthinkable happens in the pool, they are the first ones on the scene, potentially saving someone’s life and I think a major sporting organization should acknowledge and respect that instead of implying that they are just failed competitive swimmers."
