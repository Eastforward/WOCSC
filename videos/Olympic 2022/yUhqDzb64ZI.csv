"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance","These two jokes supported sotnikova who double footed a landing, couldn't perform a lutz on the outside edge (just like lipinski), and prerotated and under rotated every single jump over Yuna who skated 2 near perfect programs in sochi. They have NO ROOM to be furious over anything. They're both jokes in the skating world."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance","Where all of you were at the last OlympicsWhen Simone biles had the same issue and she was called a hero. Double standards, why? Because when US is wrong nobody thinks it’s bad but when is the enemy of US is all it’s horrible."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance",Tara and Johnny are commentators not judges
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance",All international broadcasters didnt comments anything during her short program.
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance",childish
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance",I understand what they are coming from and what is happening right now while it's still ongoing not only affects them but also the whole skating community as a whole which it was awkward to say the least.
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance","I think as commentators, Tara and Johnny should have done their jobs and not taken this so personal.  I think they were wrong.  Maybe there is a clause in their contract that says they can OPT OUT if a skater had  a bad drug test or they simply dont like what country theyre from?    idk."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance","Funny that the investigation is nowhere completed but all y’all are experts, sitting in judgement of someone whose guilt you’re somehow privy to, spearheaded by Weir and Lipinski of all people. How sad."
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance",The whole world no longer trusts WADA. Why doping scandal at this particular time. Where was WADA two months before? And this is not the first case of this corrupt organization. Why are practically all drugs manufactured in Russia banned. Although our pharmaceutists prove that many drugs are not doping.
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance",What a shame that a positive doping athlete was allowed to compete in the olympics. Insane
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance","They are not ""protesting"" Valieva; they are ""protesting"" against hte systemic doping / cheating environment that allows a positive doping athlete to slip through the cracks and actually compete"
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance",I feel sorry for the other skaters.
"Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski’s silent fury during Kamila Valieva’s 2022 Olympics performance",Lipinski and Weir arent opposers of Valieva. They are former elite competitive skaters and professional skating commentators credibly speaking about the impact this doped skater is having on the sport and these entire games. The IOC which should be concerned about the health dangers of their condoning doped skating- 'and should have sent her home to be monitored by a doctor - isn't responsibly adhering to its own motto. All of this makes the broadcasting of this Olympic short program very hard - for everyne but doping caught (again) Russia.
