Gymnasts try 'Olympic Snowboarding' for the FIRST time!? {Beijing 2022},"Illuminati = the work of a dying organization,
China is not the center of the world and cannot aim for the world. Their own world, which was falsely manipulated, is now over.
The evidence is from the world-class festival Olympics.
Chinese players believe in lies behind the biased judgment...I intentionally made a fake gesture...
And the elimination party! A sense of damage to Korean players...You can never be strong with such a false contradiction.
I'm just a big coward...
Illuminati = Shadow Government = False Organization = False Manipulation = Greedy Pig = Evil greed!They're just a bunch of cannibals.He's manipulated with false organizational connections because he doesn't have the ability! The manipulation of trying to make the situation the same...Doppelganger... Deja vu...The organization that makes it... Illuminati...
Manipulated world = elimination situation to match the situation with a beggar...
The world is now checking the reality of Illuminati...I can't use my strength...
Illuminati's attack... It's the situation of the Chinese Winter Olympics.
The eliminated player should never give up his self. As if he were the loser of the wrong spot! He's trying to steal the gold medal.
The purpose of the invasion of Ukraine in Russia is = trying to steal a second human being, which means that when Trump is elected, he can keep it safe.
The Ferry Sewol incident stole not the second human being in Korea..."

Gymnasts try 'Olympic Snowboarding' for the FIRST time!? {Beijing 2022},"I learned to ski in 2020, took one lesson and hit the slopes at mount bachelor for a school trip the following week and it was definitely an adventure. Fell down but learned to ski better. Especially in crappy conditions. Now I‚Äôm getting more comfortable doing jumps even thought the skis and ski boots are a lot heavier than a snowboard lol. I had 3 accidents yesterday up at timberline but I fought myself and my quads are on fire! But I went down my first blues instead of doing greens which are now boring to me üòÇ"
