Putin attended the Beijing Winter Olympics only to do one thing,Russia will not help India if India go to war with China or Pakistan.  Buying weapons from Russia will not mean anything to Russia.
Putin attended the Beijing Winter Olympics only to do one thing,"Dear sir, I'm afraid I'm unable to agree with some of your  statements. That's not about arguing over some issues it's more showing different angles of same thing.Say you  mentioned about his tiredness. He is over seventy,he is on the verge of war with former colleague is and to some extent his comrade,and neighbor too, then he flies to Beijing to solve something.And
then he is invited as very welcome person ,very important person and political heavyweight
and he is asked to be present at
the opening of Olympic games. Are you surprised  when he closes his eyes ,take some deep breath and that very moment
 somebody takes a picture of him..Then he must to skip rest of
 ceremonies and run home.
 while expecting to fullfil additional duties.So some understanding might be of help.
Same about treating Chinese colleague inferiorly.Good politician never has enemies/ or he does not show that,also never 
treats anyone with disrespect.Todays enemy of yours may be needy and valuable 
partner.May by.But you are not loosing that chance. That's why Mr.Putin is well respected everywhere."
Putin attended the Beijing Winter Olympics only to do one thing,"The Russians do not need to worry about India looking at Russian territory and saying, ""These lands are historically Indian, and we want these lands back"", but that is not true with China, who has already mentioned that part of the Russian Far East was taken from China in an ""unjust"" treaty and is historically theirs.      Russia is also in a difficult position with China in that Russia is right now isolated in the world and facing a deeper isolation if it invades Ukraine, so it needs China.    But you can bet that China views Russia as the subordinate in this relationship, something that cannot sit well with Putin.   

At the same time, while I think it is important for India to maintain its historical ties with Russia, India's political future lies with the Quad.     Russia has given tacit support to China's attempts to annex the South China Sea and to eventually annex Taiwan, in exchange for China's support of Russia's potential invasion of Ukraine and its political battle with NATO.     

Russia needs China right now but is competing directly with China in the former Soviet nations like Kazakhstan, etc.      They are not natural allies but instead natural rivals."
Putin attended the Beijing Winter Olympics only to do one thing,Simply - Keep your friends close and your enemy closer!! - Do not trust russia.
Putin attended the Beijing Winter Olympics only to do one thing,Question? India gives its loyalty to Russia but if India has to go to war with China will Russia give its loyalty to India. Whose side do you think Russia will be on. My guess is Russia will opt out to defend India and take a neutral position just like India did. If the world falls apart who will come to assist India if they need help? Russia will never go against China to defend India. Be careful of how you choose your friends because they can easily become your enemy.
