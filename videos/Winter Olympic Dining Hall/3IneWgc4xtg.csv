I wish peace and love on China with democracies someday. and also freedom on Hongkong, Tiwan, Tibet and so on. 

Long time ago China was great I heard. But there's no such country anymore. There's only the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now. I hope China born again this time. Bc I know some good people there

God save China 🙏"

"Germany athletes protest at Beijing Olympics as inappropriate sports facilities, rooms and food","OMG! Did the CCP propaganda ever pulled one over on the people watching the Olympics(if even anyone is). When you watch the skiers going down the ski jump and doing their aerials, you don’t get to see about 100 yards away the cooling towers and the sky high smokestacks and the huge boilers. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there’s also the sprinkling of fake snow on the jump ramp. The ski jump is built in the middle of a defunct factory zone in Beijing. It’s a god-awful site. Please IOC, next time you award the winter Olympics to a country, please ensure they have mountains and snow and proper facilities for the events and for the athletes. PS. A water pipe broke in the brand new Olympic athletes quarters sending torrents of water from the upper floors through to the bottom through the walls and light fixtures and electrical outlets.The athletes are getting to see firsthand Chinese tofu construction. See the facility in its full colorful glory at Shougang Industrial Park, 68 Shijingshan Road, Shijingshan District, Beijing: https://youtu.be/eHXmticYmvo"

"Germany athletes protest at Beijing Olympics as inappropriate sports facilities, rooms and food","Why are so many people so hostile to China? Most of u've never ever been to China. Has China ever hurt you? Please thinking with your own brain, not the media's. Come and have a look by yourself. We have 1.4 billion people and we are very well all the time."

"Germany athletes protest at Beijing Olympics as inappropriate sports facilities, rooms and food","Instead of watching a ""news channel"" in the form of slideshows, why dont yall watch actual athletes videos on the Olympics?? Too scared they're showing the opposite of what ur Western media is telling you??"
"Germany athletes protest at Beijing Olympics as inappropriate sports facilities, rooms and food","Funny! most reports from Athletes from all over the world make YouTube videos and was pleased with facility and atmosphere. 
However there are some crying in the quarantine room due to them being infected with Covid 19. We symphatize for her but what to do, she cannot mix with the Olympic village and spread Covid 19 to other healthy athletes. There are a lot of hardworking athelets that are ready to complete.

Have this youtuber been to China Olympics and report us back the Truth. I doubt so....
