USA's Boycott FAILURE...Eileen Gu Wins Gold! Beijing Olympics 2022,How much did they pay you for this conspiracy?
USA's Boycott FAILURE...Eileen Gu Wins Gold! Beijing Olympics 2022,"The Winter Olympics have always been less popular than the Summer Olympics. This time, the Beijing Winter Olympics are really popular. I really want to thank Biden for his boycott and great free advertisements. Cheers to China! In America now, the US government will be opposed everything what China does or China-related, no matter right or wrong. America will never allow anyone to challenge its supremacy. If you surpass me, I must use all means to suppress you and punish you. The US media is one of the means,  often spread false reporting. Should YouTube do something about it, like fact-check? It is natural and normal for a person to yearn for better treatment. With China's prosperity and rise, it has attracted elites and talents from all over the world. China is now attracting elites and talents from all over the world just like the United States did half a century ago. But the United States never said they betrayed their country to join the United States? Another attraction of China is security. A person walking in the middle of the night will not feel afraid, because China is too safe. Let me ask, does anyone in the United States dare to walk in the middle of the night?"
