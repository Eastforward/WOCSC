At least, Americans,  and Korean athletics don't have to worry about the food from Fukushima because the two governments perpare their food for their athletics. However; Japanese never mentioned about USA athletics or USA government.  Hilarious"

Olympic Games: The dining hall,"Japan has officially said they'd provided the foods produced from Fukushima 
where people are banned entering the area and still dangerous due to radioactive contamination.
and now Tokyo Olympic village is feeding the nuclear contaminated Fukushima food to Olympic athletes as a show.

This is not a joke. Don't get blood cancer. You are not a lab testing mice...
Please please be alert and be very careful about what you eat and drink in Japan. 
Please ask your team leader to provide radiation detector to check all the food you are contacting..
