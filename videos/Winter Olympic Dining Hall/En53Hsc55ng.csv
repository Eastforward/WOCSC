"Olympic drama and friendship: Foreign reporter fakes being ""dragged away"", NYT upset | Beijing 2022",I have the feeling that China is cutting off business deals with the Netherlands. In response the Dutch cut off the deal of street security cameras of a Chinese company. They say that China can spy on them. That is childish because China can spy with satellites.
"Olympic drama and friendship: Foreign reporter fakes being ""dragged away"", NYT upset | Beijing 2022","The female NOS - Dutch reporter before Sjoerd, did the same. With a purpose they go on restricted areas. If they do this in the US, and Latin America, they brutally would be dragged down to the ground. Then handcuffed and get jailed. Chinese are softies."
