Winter Olympics 2022 - Around the village #2 (What to do & Dining situation),All this and the American media is still on overdrive slandering China day in and day out. They should bow down to them for taking such good care of their athletes. I mean don't they ever take a break from all the bull crap propaganda they report. Stop. Thank you and we love you China.

Winter Olympics 2022 - Around the village #2 (What to do & Dining situation),"Surely that is NOT the same dining hall the Koreans and some food connoisseu had visited? From what I learned, athletes are starving, and potentially suffering from malnutrition for the poor quality rubbish China has the gall to serve up to foreign competitors. I believe that it has gotten so bad that the Korean team had to bring in their own Korean Chefs! I suspect that you made the wrong turn and ended up in  a five-star restaurant. May be you want to give the Korean team the direction to the dinning hall you described?"
