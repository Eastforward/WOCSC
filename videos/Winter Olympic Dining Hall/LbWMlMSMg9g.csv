Ski-town residents complain of soaring prices sparked by Beijing Winter Olympics,"Just putting this out there, hopefully I'm wrong, but... Sun Tzu Quote: “The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.” Therefore; I believe the CCP may take the worlds athletes hostage at the winter games, (its already a fully fenced secure compound) in exchange of a peaceful hand over of Taiwan or at least allows CCP to attack Taiwan without outside support for Taiwan."
Ski-town residents complain of soaring prices sparked by Beijing Winter Olympics,"Is this the only negative story you can fabricate? Soon there will be many athletes. Perhaps you can report about the crowds and the noise from the ceremonies.  Then you can report about the sparse crowds. 
Yes, you can fabricate more negative stories if you try harder. Come on, you can get paid by 
US congress. It authorized $3 millions per year for smear stories about China."

Ski-town residents complain of soaring prices sparked by Beijing Winter Olympics,"The only people who care about the Olympics is governments and the athletes. No gold medal has ever helped those in need.
All that's left is infrastructure that does nothing other than use up space and cost billions.
Taxpayers would prefer affordable housing or better roads that already exist, rather than a huge bill for something that some care about whilst its happening but immediately forgotten once it's over.
If the Olympics committee want to hold them in a country they must choose a country that doesnt need to build anything to hold them."
