东风吹战鼓擂这是当时的一句名言,是毛主席语录中的一句.那时国际上处在冷战时期,而我国地理位置处东方,美英资本主义国家处在西方,这句话的意思是说中国强大了,像强劲东风,把西风（西方）压倒了.东风吹起来了,战鼓敲起来了,战鼓响起来在古战场上是通知军队冲锋,相当于后来战场上 的冲锋号,总的意思是说在强大的东风下,在战鼓的召唤下去冲锋,去战斗.这句话不单纯用在战场上,在平时完成某项工作任务前,在号召群众时常用,尤其是政治任务,当时是突出政治的时代,所以凡领导谈话,先说国际形式大好,再说国内大好形式,这几乎成了公式.
《全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗!》全世界人民一定胜利
歌曲：“东风吹，战鼓擂。现在世界上究竟谁怕谁？不是人民怕美帝，而是美帝怕人民。得道多助，失道寡助。历史的规律不可抗拒。美帝国主义必然灭亡，全世界人民一定胜利！”
lyrics:The east wind is blowing, the war drums are sounding,
Who fears who in today's world?
It's not the people who fear American imperialism,
But American imperialism who fears the people!
A just cause enjoys great support, an unjust cause enjoys none!
The laws of history can't be broken, can't be broken!
American imperialism will certainly perish,
And the people of the world will surely be victorious,
The people of the world will surely be victorious!

目前，在世界范围内，正出现一个反对美帝国主义斗争的新高潮。第二次世界大战后，美帝及其追随者不断地发动侵略战争，各国人民不断地用革命战争打败侵略者。新的世界大战的危险依然存在，各国人民必须有所准备。但是，当前世界的主要倾向是革命。
美帝国主义屠杀外国人，也屠杀本国的白人和黑人。尼克松的法西斯暴行，点燃了美国革命群众运动的熊熊烈火。中国人民坚决支持美国人民的革命斗争。我相信，英勇战斗的美国人民终将得到胜利，而美国的法西斯统治必然失败。
美帝国主义看起来是个庞然大物，其实是纸老虎，正在垂死挣扎。现在世界上究竟谁怕谁？不是越南人民、老挝人民、柬埔寨人民、巴勒斯坦人民、阿拉伯人民和世界各国人民怕美帝国主义，而是美帝国主义怕世界各国人民，一有风吹草动，它就惊慌失措。无数事实证明，得道多助，失道寡助。弱国能够打败强国，小国能够打败大国。小国人民只要敢于起来斗争，敢于拿起武器，掌握自己国家的命运，就一定能够战胜大国的侵略。这是一条历史的规律。
　　全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！
People Of The World, Unite
And Defeat The U.S. Aggressors
And All Their Running Dogs
帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎
“世界的风向变了。去年气候不大好，今年气候很好。现在世界正在大变，不是西风压倒东风，就是东风压倒西风。

西风就是以美帝国主义为首的西方列强，东风就是新崛起的社会主义国家。
