A taste of South Korea: Here’s what’s for dinner at the 2018 Olympics,"My family went to South Korea in 2010, but at that time, I was still a middle schooler and barely knew anything that I encountered, so I didn't really intake a lot of information and goofed around with my siblings (haha). It's so interesting seeing my home nation hosting the winter Olympics, they really went all out to make a good entrance, and I'm proud that Korea is able and move on into what the future holds. I hope to come visit Korea again, so I can discover more again."
