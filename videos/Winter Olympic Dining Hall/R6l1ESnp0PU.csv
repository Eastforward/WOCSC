How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,"What about all the villages that get removed to make way for the olympics. All the comments in this channel are bots or Wumaos's paid to praise the government, it's embarassing reading them as you can see it's all scripted propoganda. Please explain how green it is to continually drain natural lakes and transport the water, then use electric snow making machines to turn it into artificial snow that have been running for months 24/7, just for the Olympics. Green credentials ? China don't know the meaning of the word. Just more preposterous propoganda that none in the west beleives."

How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,"I think you realize by now, worst than the comunist regime is now the perfect capitalism, multi billionaire tycoons rulers of the world have no intentions to dream forward, we never have to deal with so wealthy tycoons feeling so miserable poor that they must treat us all as perfect hostages, as beggars of a social pension just enough to pay the Russian gas bill for the home heating and finance further wars to keep our lives under threat because...true power is about the extermination camps guardians to murder us slowly because otherwise they worth nothing, think about it, what money can do for those who have all the money in the world they want...and they can not share dreams ambitions and supporter wishes as l do, making donations without any money, well, there's people capable to murder me of envy making such donations without any money because .. nothing in this world should be for free, not even the air we breathe... that's about power guys, think about it..which vision of world do we want after all? If anyone invented religions is to remind us, the hell purgatory infernal agony is elsewhere, here on earth we have the duty to be simply humans, something impossible to explain those who care so much to treat us as dead meat to be manipulated for the worst reasons. Evil is so obvious huh? How could we ever dare to believe there's anything good on the opposite side? Evil must rule above our heads"
How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,"You can bring in the HUMAN RIGHTS matter too, because giving young generations the chance to follow a sports career is about human rights friends, just do not ask what a huge frustration for a supporter like me unfit to travel and enjoy Olympic games for real as a tourist in Beijing these days, human rights is about to give the chance anyone to earn enough money, walk free and enjoy to travel as true supporter to be there, now that we use web connection as working tool as most TV reporters on the road, think about it... what is more convenient for you too Olympic games organizers and sports competitions managers"
How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,Why do you have so many books with the same title in your collection? Don’t you find that just a little bit strange?
How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,What’s with that look Robert? You know your picture where you’re holding your chin and your biceps at the same time. You remind me of Bill Murray in “lost in translation” where he goes through all those poses holding onto a glass of Suntory whiskey and he does that stupid pose just like you did.
How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,Congratulations China for promoting world peace through self restraint and helping other needy countries. God bless China abundantly.
How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,It looks like he lives in a closet
How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,Do you ever notice how Robert uses such Highfaluting vocabulary and confusing statements to confuse everybody about what he’s talking about.
How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,China shows the integration of many provinces consisting of 57 different ethnic groups into one nation with one shared future for all. China has 2000 years of experience in becoming one nation as the EU is still just a baby in terms of unification of many different groups of people. Even the usa with its less than 250 years of history is an infant in unifying large groups of people into one nation with one future for all. The west still has to learn from the east instead of feeling superior and underestimates the much older civilization.
How the Beijing Winter Olympics Exemplifies Regional Integration,Good Job and Support :)   Bravo to China Rise Peacefully and be Strong :) :)    Together for a Shared Future :) :) :)
