US athletes show the Beijing Olympic Village dining hall,"I think that China is a PR Lie Factory and the leadership there is very, very brutal to their peoples, of the same lineage or not.  The world knows very well the truth and we are boycotting the China propaganda. The Chinese common people seem to be Communists, however the Chinese leadership is a Totalitarian Monarchy Dictatorship, of the most vicious type. China is working on scientific modernization, but they are a millennia behind on civility, compassion, morals, ethics and good will. Take a lesson from history’s King Cyrus the Great. We did. King Cyrus said, “Success should always call for showing greater kindness, generosity and justice; only people lost in darkness treat it as an occasion for greater greed.”  He also said, “Whenever you can, act as a liberator. Freedom, dignity, wealth-these three together constitute the greatest happiness of humanity. If you bequeath all three to your people, their love for you will never die”"

US athletes show the Beijing Olympic Village dining hall,"People are not born silly, but caused by the acquired silly education. Especially those who don't have the opportunity to see the real China can only get their so-called correct understanding of China from the false reports of Fox/BBC/New York Times which have lost the basic principles of news authenticity and fairness. When the media becomes a political tools, people need the ability to think independently and distinguish between authenticity and falsehood. Unfortunately, those arrogant media first lost this ability and became silly people."
