Beijing Winter Olympics: 2022 Games shrouded in controversy • FRANCE 24 English,"Yes but let's face it, nobody really cares about these Olympics anyway, do they? Apart from the ludicrous fake snow very few spectators are allowed and they are completely overshadowed by the Uighur genocide, the clampdown in Hong Kong and the censoring of the tennis player Peng Shuai. Many people will boycott them and rightly so."

Beijing Winter Olympics: 2022 Games shrouded in controversy • FRANCE 24 English,"Hitler's Berlin Olympics and Xi's Beijing Olympics, some serious similarities..

Not enough food. Inedible meals. No training equipment. Some Olympic athletes unlucky enough to test positive for the coronavirus at the Beijing Olympics feel their quarantine conditions are making a bad situation much worse.

“My stomach hurts, I’m very pale and I have huge black circles around my eyes. I want all this to end. I cry every day. I’m very tired,” Russian biathlon competitor Valeria Vasnetsova posted on Instagram from one of Beijing’s so-called quarantine hotels.

Her problem wasn’t with any symptoms of the virus. It was the food.

Vasnetsova posted a picture Thursday of what she said was “breakfast, lunch and dinner for five days already” — a tray with food including plain pasta, an orange sauce, charred meat on a bone, a few potatoes and no greens.

She said she mostly survived on a few pieces of pasta because it was “impossible” to eat the rest, “but today I ate all the fat they serve instead of meat because I was very hungry.” She added she lost a lot of weight and “my bones are already sticking out.”

The quarantine hotels are increasingly the target of criticism from athletes and their teams, who are lobbying organizers for improvements. There’s a lack of transparency, too, with only some virus-positive athletes forced into quarantine hotels where their teams don’t have access, while teammates in similar situations are allowed to isolate within the Olympic village."
