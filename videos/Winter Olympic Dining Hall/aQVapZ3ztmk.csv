Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,"don't believe that only Russia athletes use doping in the international sports competitions, other countries never use it?"
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) =  FSB KGB = Made BY Putin the Killer =  ALL RODC ( D=DOPED ) ARE DOPED
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,"From what I read the Russian skater was taking a medication for ‚Äúher heart‚Äù. The medication allows the blood to flow easier in one‚Äôs system. Therefore it‚Äôs considered to be form enhancing. The whole point of this is is that it‚Äôs on the list of drugs athletes are not allowed to take. She took the drug she should be disqualified. USA wins the gold, etc."
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,Good that China aint first.
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,Well must be 15 year old so she prob wont be competing.
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,"What exactly are these legal issues, that is what we want to know, but instead we are hearing nothing. I find that objectionable and I do not wish to lose my bottom dolar on your nonsense report"
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,"Banned substance? Yes. They lose, end of story. Silken Laumenn took a banned substance in a cold remedy by accident‚Ä¶ disqualification. Should be same here. Why the legal battle? It should be a done deal."

Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,The judge have to be bias to survive
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,I‚Äôm in complete shock‚Ä¶ not
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,"If they can disqualified ski jumpers for wearing the wrong outfit, surely they can dq someone for doping. The skijump was team event too by the way."
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,If anyone is keeping track another Russian got busted for doping. My guess is it just like before they‚Äôll get a slap on the wrist and nothings going to change. What‚Äôs the point of having these rules if Russia never is held accountable? They weren‚Äôt banned they just had to change the name of their Olympic committee. This is embarrassing.
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,Nice.
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,"Another doping charge? Why can't the Russians ever play fair? They are good enough, if not better than most, yet, they just cannot seem to stop CHEATING!!"
Beijing Winter Olympics: Team figure skating medal ceremony delayed over legal issue,"If this turns out to be true, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised given their past violations.
They continue to abuse the rules but are allowed to compete."
