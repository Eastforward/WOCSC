2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,She should use her father's last name not her mother's.  It's messed up. Yes she is half Chinese but she should be using her father's last name.
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,How many comments have mentioned the Chinese ice hockey squad of 35 and containing only 7 Chinese. Does this make these overseas players traitors? Just asking.
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,"Gu Ailing did not dare to disclose her American nationality, for fear of losing her mainland fans, the Chinese thought she had given up her American nationality.  China does not recognize dual nationality.  I've checked online and found until now she and her mom are both US citizens.  Her income in China has to be taxed in China and also in the United States. If she also pays taxes to the United States, the American people will also benefit. I am an American citizen and I will also benefit.  Although her gold medal belongs to China, so the Chinese Communist Party also gets the honor, but the Chinese people get nothing.  But as a native American citizen, isn't she also famous for the United States? There are several Harvard University students in my extended family. I don't know how poor, greedy and ignorant people are to let their children participate in this dangerous sport.  Have you ever seen someone from an elite middle-class family with money, status or intelligence let their children participate in such dangerous sports?  In the United States, some children from ordinary families want to rely on sports to get college admissions and scholarships, although some sports are less harmful to the body.  Gu has broken bones in three places, and her future will be tortured by pain. In the future, her body will be paralyzed and death may be possible.  She may have a tough time coming back to America, and not all Americans have a forgiving heart.  Most of these students who rely on sports to enter prestigious schools finally choose a not-so-difficult major in sports, English and psychology.  There are risks, but no one can stop the children of ordinary families from coming and going."
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,"There are many reasons for which Eileen Gu chose to compete for China, of which the 2 most important are:

1. China is a very big market. Every Western company wants to get into that market. If she gets medals, the Chinese people will rally around her and will buy everything she endorses, so big Western companies as well as Chinese ones will pay her big money for her to endorse and promote their products.

2. Her mother is from China, China is becoming a superpower, the West, led by its gang leader the US, is hostile against China without China's provocation. As she's aware she's half Chinese, she couldn't stand this unfair hostility, so she decided to take the China side.

Now, to my friends the Chinese people in mainland China, it's ok you love her, but don't love her too much to the point of worshipping her, lest she becomes arrogant and thinks she's above the law, as already happening with ""celebrities"" in the West, which consist of movie actors/actresses, music stars, basketball players, YouTube posters, and everything in between."
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,"She said sport is about people‚Äôs peace, not political control."
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,"In a country with so many anti asian attacks taking place daily, Eileen is making a statement!"
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,Still china is in 8 th place. Very sad. How is it going to go to 1st place in less than a week? Please pray for the 1st place.
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,"Because CCP stole its people‚Äôs money and paid foreigners to compete in the Winter Olympics. You guys are so stupid.
Why does Gu still have access to Twitter in China? Isn‚Äôt it banned?

2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,The latest I've read is that Eileen has made up to $30 mil USD.  I reckon even Donald Trump would snowboard for CCP China for that.
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,"Communist Chinese    have chosen  wrong leader  to be represending  the communist  china 

Ever since   SHIT   JEEN   PEEING  leader of the communist  china

Ever since SHIT JIN PEEING took over the top position 
Communist  china now transformed  in to   MIFA   GANGSTER country 

Communist china  have sent so many industrial  spy to all over the world  to  digging out  so many advance  countries  top secret technology  by doing computer hacking

Communist  Chinese  never been in position to creating anything  of their own 
Communist  Chinese  always been stealing illegallly from others projects that already  been made  by others

Communist  Chinese  could be the  most numbers of  the industrial  spy sending country 

If it wasn't  for the communist  Chinese  industrial  spy  best effort 
Communist  Chinese technology  skill level   would not be in current  position

If the communist  china truly want to be the world top country 
Please stop stealing  some other countries  top secret"
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Another Takeoff for China & the World!,"Videos like this is why people all around the world are frustrated about China. It seems they still and really  don‚Äôt even know the reasons. So sad. I‚Äôve always expected China would become a great friend as I did in 2000 and have disputed with anti-Chinese haters. But lately I‚Äôve been disappointing again and again about China, more specifically their govt. They need someone wise like Deng Xiaoping badly as soon as possible. Be chill, nice, humble and gentle. Everything seems very bad and dangerous. Good luck."

But when China recruit an American, everyone loses their mind.
