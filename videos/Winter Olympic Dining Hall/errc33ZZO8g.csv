"Ice, snow activities boom across China as Winter Olympics fever takes hold","In 2008, due to Beijing hosting the Olympics, the city got a facelift, dilapidated traditional Hutong alley and old neighborhoods were refurbished to their former glory.
Subways were built, and many community sports facilities and parks were built as well. The quality of life in Beijing increased considerably 
2022 Olympics saw investment going in Winter sports industries and Ski resorts, this would encourage people to be even more active during the cold winters
It will also boost the economy in the long run through sports entertainment industries. Just think of the many Chinese buying Winter sports gears, and how much demand it would generate

This is why vast majority of Chinese loves the Olympics and supports hosting them, because the government has a strategic long term plan for each Olympic and it genuinely benefits the country.
Not every country can claim the same, the 2004 Athens Olympics made the debt problem in Greece even worse, and the venues were abandoned, similar problem existed for the Rio 2016 Olympics

So you really need a competent government to host the Olympics properly."
