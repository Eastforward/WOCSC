"South Korea’s CAS appeal over Winter Olympics short track officiating, even BTS are involved!",Good for Korea. China has notoriously cheated and everyone has turn a blind eye. They cheated with the Canadian skaters as well. These Olympics have been an absolute disaster for China so far.
"South Korea’s CAS appeal over Winter Olympics short track officiating, even BTS are involved!","as a Chinese, I wanna say that I know on the olympics SK vs. China SK foul to get the golden medal,
a Chinese player on the olympic her left check get scratched by the sharp part of the skate shoes that the scene of the battle was in a ice park, but later found out SK is cheating to win the game so changes into champion for China.
after this, some SK netizen start saying we steal their traditional culture such as the hanfu, saying everything from China was their,
LOL, hanfu was created at first on Tang Dynasty, more early than Tang Dynasty, I personal love SK but some SK people I hate a lot, saying we steal everything that suppose were them,
their lenguages even were given, borrow it by the emperor Qing of
China, on past years their name wasn't SK, SK this name was given after when the world war 2 ends, there were a complete but they separate as North Korea and South Korea,
this time is SK start attacking saying our foods were disgusting, too little.
too little is because everyone is same as you, eating too much for the battle on olympics isn't good too,
even Japan this time stand out saying Chinese food were given equally, non of them have much foods,
and like they say everything from us were are SK,
I have a lot of reasons to tell out:
on 1906, several Chinese were get forced to eat the most dangerous drug in those times
that in Chinese is called ""Ya Pian"" which is Opium, this drug was that dangerous that for a seconds or minutes it could
die. more than 2,00,000 Chinese people dies, on those time since we were losing, we were on our most difficult times,
then JP and Korea cames to ""steal"" our tradition culture when we are get hurted by them,
more than 2,00,000 Chinese people dies not only because of the drug:
1. Tang-shan biggest and dangerous earthquake that came because JP throw atomic bomb into China
and it can cause big earthquake.
2. WW1 and WW2 every Chinese soldiers were trying to protect our country to not get steal it.
3. on 1937, JP and Korea enters to our country without permission and
destroy everything, steal every foods, anything that we need.
this is why does times we ate dogs, cats, or bugs because no one want to die.
every single Chinese people on there were kill and tortured really disgusting way...
kids were the long knife they have and enters to the neck,
 the children bones were get created as their ciggarates.
young girls of 3 years old to 50 women were
 taken into a kinda big house, the house have each
individual rooms, the girls and women were get closed
inside and when the JP and Korean Soldiers when they are bored they
go violated the girls and women, torture (knife was scratching on the intimate parts of the women).

I personally don't hate any countries of the people because not
all of them are this.
so right now about BTS scandals;
this SCANDALS WAS TOTALLY FAKE.
they aren't racist of Chinese, if youy keep think they are,
then why Taehyung would learn Chinese to speak with Chinese
army? then why Yoongi has say he like Chinese girls, they even 
comes up a Chinese song.
this called they are racist?
when the fake scandal everyone of you were there attacking
and want BTS give a explanations, so after BPD told out everything,
then what are you guys reaction?
you want them give a explanation, yes they give but then you don't want it.
I don't care if you leave the fandom, you can dislike,
but hating on them then is your faults, the one who insult us
are other some Korean netizens, not BTS,
we are Chinese, is not polite too if they hate us, then we
attack too to them.
is not correct if we attack them too as a defend, NO.
stay calm, what they does at the end they would get
results.
now a hand pose which is this one:
👌
were considered as a good defend to those SK netizens.
this emoji have 2 meaning, one is describing your dick is too small, 
and other is Korea is too small for China."
