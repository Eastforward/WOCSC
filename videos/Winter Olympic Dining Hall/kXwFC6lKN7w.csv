Beijing Winter Olympics 2022 | Worse Food Being Served To Athletes In Quarantine |Valeria Vasnetsova,"I wonder if gourmet curry is available in the Olympic village? I think it is highly unlikely because there is only ONE Indian skier. He is the only proud flag bearer of a population of 1.4 Billions. And here we have a country which is big on boycotting, and light on performance, bitching about the conditions of the Olympics when a mere SINGLE person made it to the game. 

Bones ticking out? I have seen plenty of Indians who live on the shanty towns, many of them are Dalits, do look like that...near starvation, with rib bones ticking out."

They should take their own food to China. I mean It's a very strange country.  Homepets like cats and dogs are beaten to death for make a meal of them. Burned alive and such cruel things are there very normal. When you travel through the country, you will not find any sink in a public toilet. So their don't wash their hands ðŸ™ˆ  The people spit on the streets without shame... You see it everywhere. And its only possible to drink water from closed bottles. So better don't eat there things that you don't cook by yourself"
