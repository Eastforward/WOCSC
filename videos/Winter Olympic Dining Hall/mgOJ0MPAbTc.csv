Beijing 2022 Olympic Village cuisine loved by athletes,"One's  preference for food is very subjective. It makes it more tricky when politics, yes, politics in food, becomes entangled in it. As per usual, some anti-China YouTube sites gave some athletes from certain countries the microphone to lodge complaints about the quality of food being served. According to an Indian site, the food is so poor that the athletes are suffering from malnutrition, and their bones are sticking out from starvation. i believe that, especially from India. But there are a few dodgy sites with known history of anti-China propaganda, also wheeled out a ""select"" few to bitch and moan about everything, from the surveillance, the security, Covid measures, the size of their room, poor hygiene, and of course the food not being to their liking.

This reminds me of a friend I used to work with. While he was a a school in a third world country. Why was he living in a 3rd world country when he belonged to the developed world? His father was in the air force of the British Empire, and that country was one of the colonies. He told me about the wonders of the street foods. Walking home from school, he would stop to have a feast of fried noodles, curry, etc, from many nationalities. For a feast, he paid a mere 30 cents. Yes, 30 cents of the local money. But that was the time one could buy a T-shirt for $1. Anyway, His parents never liked the idea of him eating street foods. Why? Hygiene is the main concern of course. But it has much to do with a superiority complex. Somehow his parents believed that foods in an Asian 3rd world country is NEVER to be trusted. He told me that he had done that for the many years while in school, and never ever once fell sick from the food. He tried to convince his parents to go and have a try. Being the colonial mindset still firmly in their head, they flatly refused. 

What is telling is that he was working as a geologist alongside my department. He didn't die, and didn't suffer any long term hidden health issues as a result of eating street foods from a 3rd world country. I believe that some of the negative comments and complaints arose from the fact that those athletes still carry with them a superiority complex all the way to Beijing. Somehow China is not at a par with their home country. That I can understand, but disagree. It is their choice to take or leave the food put in front of them. It is only two weeks. They can stuff themselves with Kimchi and whatever to their liking. But while they are still in China, it would help to shut the F up as it reflects poorly on themselves more than it would on the host China."

I got really pissed off when I saw the news commenting about how there‚Äôs not enough food for the athletes. This video made me feel a lot better, at least the athletes are telling the truth. I am glad that the athletes are enjoying the Chinese foods, competition second, friendship first!"

We call it beggar‚Äôs chicken ÔºàÂè´Ëä±È∏°Ôºâin Chinese cuisine and it has been around for the longest time. I was also served one dish in bamboo steamers (Ëí∏Á¨º), a great Chinese invention we use to steam buns and Xiao Long Bao. The French chef was highly acclaimed, nevermind if he had borrowed  some ideas or gotten his inspiration from Chinese traditional cooking techniques."
