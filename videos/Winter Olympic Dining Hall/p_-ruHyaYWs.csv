GLOBALink | Chinese go warm and fuzzy over Winter Olympics mascot,"I pray for human rights of Chinese people. No more massacres No more dictators No more tortures No more deceivings......

I wish peace and love on China with democracies someday. and also freedom on Hongkong, Tiwan, Tibet and so on. 

Long time ago China was great I heard. Who made China the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now? I hope the government born again this time. Bc I know many good people there

God save China 🙏"

GLOBALink | Chinese go warm and fuzzy over Winter Olympics mascot,"Perhaps because China has a lot of fakes, the Olympics must be fake.This is the Olympics without the ""Olympic spirit."" They obviously don't know what the Olympics are for. China says its own country is a great country, but China does not have anything great. They have been controversial over human rights abuse issues, so US should boycott them. How can a country with a low level of human rights know sportsmanship? Most athletes have already been disqualified for no reason at this Olympics, so everyone knows, but this Beijing Olympics in China must be the worst Olympics."

GLOBALink | Chinese go warm and fuzzy over Winter Olympics mascot,"中华民族有底线，维护我们华夏民族不被换血替换的底线，但是共畜党为了短期的经济利益和其自身的国际合法性，拿华夏民族的血脉作为筹码去交易，大肆引入黑人，从幼儿园黑外教开始洗脑我们的孩子，时不时拿出中华文明和华夏民族无关的虚无历史主义，淡化华夏血缘继承的重要性，为黑人鹊巢鸠踞，染黑炎黄子孙,占据我华夏族耕耘5000年的唯一国度做铺垫。我们的每一寸土地都留着祖先们的血和汗，而中国共畜党就要将这份土地献祭给非洲最一事无成的种族，流血流汗为国家付出生命的先贤英烈们地下有知，该做和感想？"
