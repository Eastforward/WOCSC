Long time ago China was great I heard. But there's no such country anymore. Who made China the dirtiest global criminal enterprise in the world now? I hope the government born again this time. Bc I know many good people there

"Olympic athletes complain of bad food, poor communication in quarantine",Considering China is known for filtering sewage waste to reuse as food oil i wouldn't eat what they're giving out.. they're probably feeding their competitors prison scrap compared to what they feed their country olympians.
"Olympic athletes complain of bad food, poor communication in quarantine","The USA athletes should have stayed home. There's no real natural snow there, kinda like Bochi and both had to manufacture snow and that's a problem."

"Olympic athletes complain of bad food, poor communication in quarantine","Like anyone should be surprised of horrid conditions in a communist country? I was in Bejing for a work project nine years ago... put up in a private hotel on a secured campus... owned by a near-billionaire art dealer... and living quarters were still somewhat below standards for any American. But, I will say, we were fed extremely well. Our hosts warned us about sticking close to them and were always looking out for our safety. I can only imagine how much more challenging things might have been if we were completely on our own."
