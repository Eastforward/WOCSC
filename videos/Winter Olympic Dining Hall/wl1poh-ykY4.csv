China’s obsession with Beijing Winter Olympic panda mascot sparks souvenir buying spree,"If the ""Bing Dwen Dwen""  is entirely made in Xinjiang & made of Xinjiang materials, would it be illegal for all the American athletes winning Olympic awards ( BDDs  with carved motifs of gold, silver  & bronze binding their silhouettes ) to take them back to the USA ??   
In addition, all other Americans ( athletes & their support teams, journalists ) won't be allowed to take any gifted or purchased ""Bing Dwen Dwen"" back to their country !!!
The USA has banned the import of all Xinjiang products !!!    

You should never under-estimate the brilliance of the Chinese government for such subtle retaliation !!! What classy humour is being played !!!
Would the journalists please kindly check this out?  I'm dying of curiosity."
