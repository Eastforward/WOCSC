US Snowboard Team member achieves legions of Chinese fans during Winter Olympics,"Waw I always held China in high regard because of everything they have offered to the world and their ancient civilization. Without China everything would be so expensive and we would be doomed. Their people are always so sweet and polite. I can't stand it when they bash China in the media, it makes me angry. The world is nothing without China and the chinese people. Spread love to China. Love from Canada."

US Snowboard Team member achieves legions of Chinese fans during Winter Olympics,"life can be good for everyone, if people chose to be good people, appreciate difference, and tolerances. warmongering is tearing the world apart and causing people go against their natural good state of being, now they hate, because bad leaders tell them to hate, they murder because bad leaders want to take resources of others. Go against the grain when right, go against bad, don’t just do because it benefits you, do what’s right even if it won’t benefit you. do what’s right no matter what."

US Snowboard Team member achieves legions of Chinese fans during Winter Olympics,"I wish all Americans would see videos like these from western athletes who appreciate the beauty, efficiency, warmth, friendliness, and spirit of the Beijing Olympics, so they could get a fair sense of this great event put on by the Chinese people.  Unfortunately, many Americans have been persuaded by the propaganda and hatred and have thus denied themselves the beauty of this Olympics due to their hatred and gullibility.  No problem because most of the world no longer gives a damn what America thinks or is deceived by the hatred and manipulation that the west pushes."
