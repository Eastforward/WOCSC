US athlete: China has done a “stellar job” with COVID-19 protocols for the Winter Olympics 2022,"This won't change anything about western media staying in their closed bubble to shield any truth and meanwhile injecting a tons of fake news about China but still cheers to these athletes  that could speak up what they saw and felt. Same as any countries on the planet, China has good, bad and ugly part of it. Western media simply ignore the good, but however missed significantly on the bad and ugly part as well because it is much easier to just inject fake news than dig deep to discover the true bad things. Being in a closed bubble with propagandas is a sad truth with all the information and technology developments."
