2022 Winter Olympics Village in Zhang Jiakou Comes to Final Stage of Preparation,"<< BOYCOTT THE CHINESE OLYMPICS >>

Boycott all Olympic Games held in China. The upcoming Chinese Winter Olympics are important in boosting its prestige and standing on the global stage. The most important non-monetary priority for China is ibcreasing their  ""PRESTIGE"". Boycotting any Olympics that take place in China is the best way to send a message to the dictator in Beijing and to everyone of the beautiful  Chinese people living under this tyrant, that we will not forgive the destruction that their WUHAN VIRUS brought to billions of peoples' lives on our planet. Teach them that everything has a price."
