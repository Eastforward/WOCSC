Visiting Japan’s Winter Village | Ginzan Onsen,"It's interesting comparing this video to Kuga's Travel and his magical wander through the snow covered Ghibli town set to soft piano music. Whereas here we have the real experience of getting there; children crying on the train, standing in the cold waiting for the next bus, finishing the journey in essentially somebody's van. It reminds you that travel isn't always glamorous or idealized. But the destination is so worth the experience."
