Travels to China and Olympic Village Arrival,"With all the influx of athletes coming from all over, their protective gear is a must for your own protection and for themselves as well. Good job to China for handling all the different aspects of the olympics so smoothly. Well done."

Travels to China and Olympic Village Arrival,"It's much hotter in summer time. But that's how China fight against the covid. That's very hard, but they sacrifice themselves to keep everybody safe.

Travels to China and Olympic Village Arrival,"Nice place and looks like very clean air.
Couple of questions, I am very curious, because in europe we only read the msm, so also the negative articles.
1) Were there any problems with your internetconnections? Is it from ATOS, they are the IOC it service supplier. Did you need a vpn, was it hard to do so, because you can upload to youtube.
2) The tv channels, are they only chinese, or also western channels, or foreign channels?
3) The food in the restaurants, how is it? Also halal food? I read in the msm (US) that the food was very bad in the restaurant and also in the quarantine hotel."
