S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"Do Koreans really know what better food is? kimchi in China is served as side dish, not considered as a real dish, Korean  ramen is considered as junk food, only when people are really in rush and has no time to cook, they eat it. Koreans food are so lack of variety and delicacy, it's so funny to hear they need better food"
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"Sorry,  we are unable to serve our distinguished Korean guests. Koreans are too top classed to serve. Sorry again. Next time, have your all Korean food air-freighted."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"What about the watermelon? Korean athletes love a lot,  LOL"
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"Hard to imagine. if you refuse Chinese food, I realldy dont know what else can you refuse."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"Korean athletes always need to feel like special. They have or say pretend to have very ‚Äúfragile‚Äù appetite. Is Korea much richer than all other the participating counties, maybe be not. But they seem to think that way. Bunch of spoiled narcissistic cry baby"
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"I find it quite rude to complain about food that's been served to you by people cooking and prepping in protective gears, imagine the hassle and hard work. They are doing their best man, if hundreds of options is still not good enough than maybe food is not the problem here, it's small-mindedness and the lack of willingness to try new things."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"Japanese athletes witnessed that Korean athletes took a lot of food from the canteen when people were not watching.
And to the worst, they took all the watermelons back to their own rooms(which made Japanese mad).
Please stick to your own words, DO NOT come to canteen any more.
Enjoy your pickles in the room."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"You know, the Korean kimchi things are more like side dish in China.
-It's not bad but not good enough to be regared as formal dish on the table.
If someone offer kimchi as main dish to visitors, he/she will be blamed as stingy."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,üòÖüòÇü§£ Probably because kimchi was not served
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"Only Koreans in the world do this, what does this mean?"
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"The editor of the video is Da-Eun Jeong, Korean  I'm not surprised by how the video content is deliberated edited to fit its narrative."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"Looks like Bill Miller's foodüôÇ. Those athletes complaing are so spoiled!! In my country many travelers who are sick stay in quarantine hotels too! Sick people in the US are also put in locked rooms. The village is fenced but well.. it is for everyone's safety since a pandemic is going on. To poor people, they are living better than them!  To middle class people, the conditions are ok. I bet it is so cool to see robots everywhere and the hotels and transportations are so nice and futuristic! The rooms for the media is very small, but well austronauts and other people live in worse conditions."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"Chinese want to give our guest best serve, food of course. But kimich is called 'cold dishes' in China, it is rude to give our guest to eat it, like you were be invited to your friend's house to have a dinner, then he or she only give you cold salad and cold bread."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"That's reasonalbe, after all if you only eat kimichi then you can not stand to eat meat sea food or some better food. Poor people do not konw what is wealthy."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"After seeing this video, all I can feel is how picky Korean Athletes are."

S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"700+ dishes and you dont like the food, then you need mental help. More korean food is so similar to Chinese anyway. Too bad better food can bring you the gold medal."
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,haha rubbish channel got boomed by comments
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"What's the big deal? If you have extra money to bring in your own chef, then whats so wrong about it?
Japanese team brought in their food in Pyeonchang 2022, US team also brought their own food in Tokyo. 
Making fun of Korean athletes ""stealing"" food from the Olympic village... omg seriously. 
The food is for everyone to eat 
Plus the food they bring in is in case some athlete's digestive system has a hard time to adapt to foreign food
Or they might just crave kimchi and shortgrain rice, which they are used to eating everyday. 
Koreans should also stop believing and spreading false news about how bad the food is - Shaun White apparently loved the food. 
Not a big deal!!"
S. Korean athletes staying out of village dining hall for better food,"We SK people invented Chinese fuud/kulture, and they had been following us all ten thousand years. Yeah, we are the masttttttterrrrrrrr"
