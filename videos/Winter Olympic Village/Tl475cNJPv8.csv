Beijing 2022: An Athlete's Diary,Good luck all and enjoy Olympics and Beijing.  We hear so much anti China rthetoric from your MSM so it's nice to hear from the true stars of the Olympics.  All the athletes have a great game.
Beijing 2022: An Athlete's Diary,"What a debacle- a ridiculous ""zero tolerance"" policy that has resulted in isolated athletes and ""imprisoned"" test positive participants.
Some athletes have missed their opportunity to particpate in their sports already after testing positive.
The CCP, IOC were idiots for carrying on the games, in the midst of such a severe COVID policy.
CCP autocracy on full display-heaven forbid they came to your country!"

Beijing 2022: An Athlete's Diary,"I'm from Canada and I really enjoy these videos. I'm tired of Canadian and western media only portraying negative news on the Beijing Olympics. The west is far from perfect and life isn't as pleasant here anymore for the average citizen so they should not criticize China so harshly, if anything I see more and more Chinese citizens living a better life with no crime in their society. One day I hope to visit China as a tourist."
