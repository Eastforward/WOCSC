""Chinese Unity & Pride""

Sing Sing to Chinese Unity & Pride worldwide.
Welcome to the most beautiful lands of the Chinese peoples, China!
This beautiful vast big country
From the mountain top of the Himalayas to the deltas of the Yellow and the Yangtze.
To the great wall of China! 
The great lands of China!
Providing for the great peoples of China. As it has been for thousands of years.
As it will continue to nurture, feed, and provide to all the needs of all of its inhabitants.
For many more thousands of generations into the future!

(Chorus):

Rise up!
Rise up!
To China's glory!
Let's China again rise to its potentials and glory
Rise up!
Rise up!
Let China rise up to its potentials and its glory with innovations and modern technologies!
Rise up !
Rise up !
And sing to the pride and glory of the Chinese peoples.

From the mainland to Taiwan island. From the provinces of Fijian to Xinjiang
From Tibet to Heilongjiang. As we include our brothers and sisters around the rest of the world.
Let's see China rise! Let Chinese sing to the glory for mankind.
Let China be the Beacon of light to lead the world for peace and good neighbor with respect and leadership with 
human kindness.

(Repeat Chorus):

Let the red flag with the golden stars shines and for what it stands for
The modern engines and symbol to build for world peace.
Let the billions of Chinese in majority who, respect the flag and the nation of laws and orders speak out loud to the 
world. Let's be the patriots who stand guard to respect the flag
from foreign interference.

(Repeat Chorus):

Yes, to protect the majority rights and security of the billion majority!
Let's be proud of your Chinese heritage.
Rise up when China shines. And together let the world too.
For China shines with you!

If you do this...your brain is not working.

Live: Visit the athlete restaurant in Zhangjiakou Winter Olympic Village,"RATHER Than be on the defensive toward the US China can do a little ""meddling"" of its own here's how!  Recently there was a violent tornado in the US State of Kentucky and an entire rural town was turned into piles of garbage or debris.  A local leader has said it will ""take years to clean up and rebuild"" .  SO HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE FOR CHINA TO ""CLEAN UP AND REBUILD"" here?  The China foreign ministry SHOULD TELL U.S. HOW TO DO THIS JOB ""PROPERLY"" AND QUICKLY using computer graphics superimposed over the rubble.  CGTN can send a news crew to Kentucky the way CNN does/did to China and continue to ""offer the US free advice"" on engineering and construction to clean up the mess."
