Peking olympialaiset OSA 1 | Zhangjiakou Olympic Village tour! #10²,"Athletes from all over the world should cherish and enjoy every day of the Beijing Winter Olympics. I believe that in the future, no matter whether you are in the Summer Olympics or Winter Olympics held in other countries, you will definitely not enjoy the treatment in China today. Not before, and never will be."

Peking olympialaiset OSA 1 | Zhangjiakou Olympic Village tour! #10²,"I’ve watched all your video and found it enjoyable. However, you seem much too suspicious about everything especially the people. I’m British and living in China for 12 years and there’s a very large population of foreigners living and working in China. I’m living south of Shanghai but in that area there are 3 British universities, two American universities and several German and French universities. China is a wonderful place to live and the people are kind and generous… they’re also innocent by western standards. I hope you get a chance to discover that on your trip and I also hope you win lots of medals. Good Luck!"
Peking olympialaiset OSA 1 | Zhangjiakou Olympic Village tour! #10²,"12:06. So you didn't realize why they want to clean stairs When it is still snowing and dark? They just worried about you may slip. That is why they clean the stairs slowly. That is Chinese culture. We don't directly tell you what shouldnot to do. But obviously their kindness didn't received by you correctly. So finally they directly told you. 
So next time when you confused something for other culture then don't show your wisdom. Just show your respect of unknown"

Peking olympialaiset OSA 1 | Zhangjiakou Olympic Village tour! #10²,Welcome to China!
Peking olympialaiset OSA 1 | Zhangjiakou Olympic Village tour! #10²,"Why do you call Beijing Peking?  
How much did you pay for your stay? Or was all this comfort for free. Did you have in Korea 2018 a 5 star ⭐️ Hotel with personal assistant? 
If you don’t like all the attention paid to you, to your health, and safety. I believe you are entitled to go home as boycott. Then China has one less to care about. 

Are you a child, that cannot asked one of the volunteers, if you have a question? I don’t like your comments, but never mind. 
I feel you are ungrateful, and l hope at the end of the day, you will have to say something positive, if you open your mind, your heart, and mouth. 
Also if you are a guest, you should say only positive things, if you cannot, just stay quiet. This is a rule for every visit in someone’s house in a civilised society. I learnt this as a child at home, never go without a present, however small to someone’s abode, and never say anything offensive while there. I am so happy l learnt this. 

What are you giving to one Chinese person you encounter from your homeland, just a small souvenir gift? I guess you only take from there, as we Whites have always done. 

Other of our white race have already commented on the living conditions in the Olympic Village positively. The Chinese have put so much effort in keeping all athletes save, and providing sports venues out of this world, that l am ashamed of your bubbling. 
I do not think, you are significant enough to spying on you. Very disappointing. Bye."
