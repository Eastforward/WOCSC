Did the CCP propaganda ever pulled one over on the people watching the Olympics(if even anyone is). When you watch the skiers going down the ski jump and doing their aerials, you don’t get to see about 100 yards away the cooling towers and the sky high smokestacks and the huge boilers. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there’s also the sprinkling of fake snow on the jump ramp. The ski jump is built in the middle of a defunct factory zone in Beijing. It’s a god-awful site. Please IOC, next time you award the winter Olympics to a country, please ensure they have mountains and snow and proper facilities for the events and for the athletes. PS. A water pipe broke in the brand new Olympic athletes quarters sending torrents of water from the upper floors through to the bottom through the walls and light fixtures and electrical outlets.The athletes are getting to see firsthand Chinese tofu construction. See the facility in its full colorful glory at Shougang Industrial Park, 68 Shijingshan Road, Shijingshan District, Beijing: https://youtu.be/eHXmticYmvo"
