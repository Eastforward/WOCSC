The hysterical attacks of the West on China show that China is doing too right and too well. They have always hoped to destroy this most charming Eastern civilization. China needs to be more confident in walking its own path to realizing its dream of common prosperity and a community with a shared future for mankind. Don't be distracted or discouraged by the West. President Xi is such a graceful and charming person, however, the West put the most negative spin on describing him as they always do when they talk anything about China. Why cannot China get the truth out to the mass in the West?

As I have observed that CGTN has failed so far in telling Chinese stories to the Western audience. They have tried very hard to appeal to or please them but forget about what their founding mission is all about. This is why so many individual social media content creators mushroomed as they believe that they have to take it into their own hands in telling the real China to the world. It is because they love China and they know that the West lies about China on almost every front.

I mentioned before and I wish to mention again that 'the World with Tianwei', 'the Point with Liuxin', and the Dialogue with Xuqingduo' are repetitive and lack depth, and are far from thought-provoking. They are too shy to praise China when China is worthy of praise. They don't themselves believe that China is a democracy how to let their audience believe? How did the U.S. let the world believe that they are the best when the fact that they are exactly the opposite? It is so obvious that 'The Summit for Democracy' is merely a political stunt, yet, CGTN has given it such a good run talking about who's invited and who's not and why, when they could have paid more attention in condemning the U.S in killing 10 Afghan innocent civilians including children. Isn't it counterproductive to keep repeating that the U.S. let few counties will diplomatic boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics, instead the time can be spent wiser in telling how well China is preparing and how much history that China will make? Good words worth repeating.

I hope to see that China is increasingly confident in leading the way and setting its own agendas instead of defending or reacting to the Western media. I wish to see more confident and upright young Chinese joining in telling the China stories with charms, depth, and thought-provoking remarks."
