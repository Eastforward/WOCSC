COME TO THE OLYMPICS WITH ME,"Japan is beautiful! I went with my family years ago. We explored Tokyo and Shibuya City. And you are totally spot on with the food comments, traveling Asia is what made me a foodie. The fruit from all over the continent is too die for, I especially love how they have food courts where you can just buy a platter of fresh fruit, we don’t have anything like that here in MN!!"
