INSANE AFTER PARTY - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics! (South Korea),"Hey I'm south Korean and thank you to the poster for reviewing knidly about Pyeongchang, but I have to inform that there was accident happened by dutch Athletes and injuring 1 Korean male resulting in severe operation. Sven Kramer insisted they've apologized ,  but the victim said that was bullshit. You know, please  be polite and behave with care when you guys go somewhere outside your home countries. Because of that incident, a bad image about the Netherlands has been grown in this country. No bullshits and be polite Dutch! Arrogant behaviors not allowed!!"

INSANE AFTER PARTY - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics! (South Korea),"You should've taken Korea's pride super fast train KTX from the Incheon International Airport to Pyeong Chang direct. KTX takes you to Pyeong Chang in only an hour at the super fast speed of over 300km/h, much faster than the bus. The KTX station is right up at the airport. You could've easily asked for the direction to KTX platform from any Korean in the airport. Try the super fast, super modern KTX next time!"
