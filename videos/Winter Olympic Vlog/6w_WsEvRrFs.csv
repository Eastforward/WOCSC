COVID cases rise in China days ahead of Olympic Winter Games l ABCNL,"I don't understand China, sometimes. 

IF ""Chinese Lunnar New Year"" is correct,
Is the example below correct? 

Israel Merry Christmas ?!?!??
Europe Thanksgiving Day ?!?!??
USA Black Friday ?!?!??Most People said ‚ÄúNO‚Äú 

Just as Merry Christmas has become common all over the world,
Of course, it's just ""Lunar New Year"" in Asia. 

Mongolia, Vietnam, Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Singapore, etc. 

""Lunar New Year"" is a Big-Holiday in many Asian countries.
This is because,
In the past, Many Asian Countries used the lunar calendar. 

China thinks that the Chinese created all world cultures.
This is called the 'Chinese Fundamental Theory'. 

China claims that the Chinese also made hockey, bowling, pizza, kimchi, and so on. 

But, it is 'FACT' that
Bowling is the origin of Egypt, Pizza is the origin of Italy, and KimChi is a traditional Korean food. 

Do you know ‚ÄúChina Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution‚Äù ??? 

From 1966 to 1976, During 10 years,
Chinese ‚Äòburned‚Äô their own culture after China became communist. 

From an Anti-communist point of view, it is also a case frequently mentioned when explaining why communism should not be practiced. 

Anyway,
At that time, ‚ÄúMany Chinese Cultures‚Äú burned down because China burned its own culture. 

SO Nowadays, that is reason why China is jealous of the world. 

Therefore,
China has been trying to steal especial ‚Äôthe popular culture of other countries‚Äô.
It is in the same context as China's illegal copying of trademarks and intellectual property rights. 

Many people in the world cannot understand China sometimes.
But it is very bad! 

What do you think about it ???"

COVID cases rise in China days ahead of Olympic Winter Games l ABCNL,"I thought I was about to hear a big surge in infections in Beijing that may jeopardize the Winter Games. I had a big relief when it was just 71 new cases, including 37 people relating to the Olympics such as athletes and team officials.

Speaking of which, China (inclusive of Beijing, the host to the Winter Olympics) is the safest place on planet earth. The following stats say it all:

Daily infection (2 Feb): +39; daily death: 0
Cumulative infection (up to 2 Feb): 106k; cumulative death (up to 2 Feb): 4,636

Well done China! Well done Beijing!"

It seems the ABC News has forgotten about what it is and zoomed in on ""spike"".
