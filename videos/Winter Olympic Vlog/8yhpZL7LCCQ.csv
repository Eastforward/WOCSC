"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",I remember when that first video clip came out. They had to clarify it and the explanation was that her contact was falling out or something (whether you believe that or not is up to you lol).
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS","As for numerous teen/young girls getting along perfectly all the time - never, EVER going to be a thing. 
I have 8 sisters. We are family. I love them. I'm sure idols truly love their families more than their members, despite their members feeling like family maybe... 
But I've also been so mad at my sister's and felt as if I've hated some of them too. Lol. So if that's a possibility between girls who have grown up together as legit family, 
It's DEFINITELY going to happen amongst girls who have NOT grown up together as legit family,
Amongst young catty possibly insecure girls (insecure people often act out towards others in order to defend and protect those insecurities- what they perceive as their weakness), girls who are in the midst of literally figuring out real life... girls who have possibly spent their past few years actively COMPETING AGAINST others who are may now be their group members, girls who have spent the past few years purposely trying to outshine the next trainee girl... 
So imagine that. That's what they've been doing for years... then suddenly they're paired up, made to live in CLOSE and not very private quarters, and then theyre told to act as if they're all just the closest of friends. 
*that is something extremely unrealistic don't you think?*
So of course there MAY or MAY NOT be feuds or little bits of dislike amongst them. There may even be real HATE and ill will wished upon eachother.
We as the ""fans"" are never supposed to know. But, I believe we as the fans should ALWAYS have that reality in our minds, and to FORGIVE SMALL things like this - which we don't even KNOW FOR SURE OR NOT is even actual dislike between members. We shouldn't blow them out of proportion, we could only possibly make the situations between them worse. And as a true fan of anything or anyone, you would never want to cause such a strife amongst people you support and like and wish the greatest of success for. 
Although, we should hold accountable those that bully and purposely hurt others blatantly. But little side glances we know no backstory about? Forget it and move on. It's nothing. Just know that it MIGHT maybe could be something small between them, but that should stay private between them to work out. It's not for us fans to bash or to tell someone to apologize or change their attitudes when we have no real idea of what's actually happening. (AOA situation for instance.)


As for homegirls stank face at the other girl,
I've personally have FELT my face make the wrong sort of looks before towards people, due to maybe not feeling well or internally being upset - and then someone around me makes a joke, and I attempt to laugh or smile a bit, yet my upset or uneasy feeling immediately comes back over that fake light laugh/smile, causing my face to feel more as if I'm scowling... imagine your happy smiling face immediately going to an expression of upset or unease... in-between those expressions it could easily appear to be a scowl or a mean face. 
Just my thoughts on that."
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS","Ok so as a Chinese person I kinda want to clarify somethings. Disclaimer I‚Äôm not an expert I just wanna provide some background info.

First of all,  the whole war of China stealing Korean is just kinda ridiculous in my opinion. Obviously it‚Äôs wrong of China to say that kimchi and hanbok is there‚Äôs since they have their own food and clothes. But it should be acknowledged that they were neighboring countries in the ancient times so some aspects of culture are similar, such as the clothing.

Second, the whole biased judging during the Olympics is not as uncommon as y‚Äôall think. The clip in this video does show the Chinese skater pushing the Korean skater and I think it looks deliberate. But Sk skaters had done the same thing so like. Also biased judging happens all the thing so u cannot expect the judges to be completely fair but I do agree if the athletes have violated rules then they should be disqualified/ penalized. 

Lastly I just wanna say that ppl should be able to support the athlete they want. If the athlete have done something wrong then sure u can inform the person it. Hate comments r too much and whoever sends those are just xssholes with too much free time"
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS","abt the wonyoung thing, i don‚Äôt stan the group or iz*one so i‚Äôm not trying to be biased but why are the clips of her being ‚Äúrude‚Äù like 5 seconds each and that‚Äôs it. people tell idols to be honest and stuff but when 2 idols have a fight or something (which is normal) they should ‚Äúact happy‚Äù?? it annoying. i‚Äôm not gonna sit here an act like a girl is a bitch because of 5 second clips. esp when we don‚Äôt know anything about her or the group (which i bet worked hard to be where they are now, but i just hope they all work together well)"
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",Poor ningning
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS","Wow how did that chines skater not get disqualified, I found that rlly unfair bc he obviously pushed the Korean skater and it‚Äôs against the rules. This shows that they don‚Äôt look nor judge correctly.üôÑ"
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",ok wtf Wonyoung needs to mature up she sure is preety she can't stand anyone take her spotlight she always been a preety girl so that got in her head and on their m countdown thing after they won the prize idols usually sing live Wonyoung being an idol for 3+ years fking lip synced while her group mate Liz who just debuted is singing live perfectly Wonyoung doesn't have any EXTRAORDINARY skills she has ok dance skills her vocals are ok and her rap is ok it's just average it's just her visual and yujin has gotten way better stage precense then her also mnet rigging her as the center LMFAOOOO it just makes me annoyed how she can't respect other she is 17 gonna be 18 and their are idols younger and same age as her they have never acted like this so I won't listen to any of your bs knetz just ignore her plastic surgery which completely changed her and hate on aespa members for their plastic surgery double standards be like:-
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",No offense to woonyoung but all I see is a pretty face with bamboo arms and legs..I feel like she's getting thinner and thinner each day hope it's not something related to health issue ü§î
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS","Well haters hating on Namjoon can hurt him but maybe he already knew this is going to happen before he posted it he saw it coming. Well haters are not going to bring them down or something they are BTS LIKE THE BANGTAN BOYS they are at the top of the game and so it doesnt matter. Armys let's not give too much attention to these haters.BTS is internationally famous and some few fans leaving won't make a big difference 

But it is kind of worrying for aespa and ningning because they have just debuted and most of their album sales and fans are from korea and china soo it can cause a little damage to them well."
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",some cnetz and some knetz equally both need therapy fr
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",I'm sorry but what do expect from China
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",Namjoon and Ningning receiving backlash for being proud Korean and Chinese/ rooting/congratulating is making me feel frustrated to some peopleüò™
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",Basically the Chinese netizens are claiming that the Korean athlete that RM supported was a cheater‚Ä¶..I‚Äôve tried looking into this and can‚Äôt find anything to support this claim. But I guess that‚Äôs why they mad at him‚Ä¶.
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS","I'm not even going to touch the Olympics, however I will say we all need to be showing more love and support for each other. But you look gorgeous, love how you do your makeup and different styles! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòä"
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",I don't believe the Wonyoung and Yujin thing because they have so many vids together talking and laughing they have the closest friendship in IVE too
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",China played dirty
"Korea VS China Olympics Outrage, IVE Members Feud Video Surfaces | HOT TOPICS",This year's Olympics is a joke!
