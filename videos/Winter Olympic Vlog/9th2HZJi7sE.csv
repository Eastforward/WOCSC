Chinese baby snowboarder featured on Beijing 2022 opening ceremony,"*China 🇨🇳, there are many news outlets saying that a teen from South Tibet which has been illegally occupied by endia, was tortured, given electric shocks, blindfolded, kicked in the stomach...kept for weeks. The teen cried, when he met his mother. China 🇨🇳 should not have done this... after all, the people are Chinese 🇨🇳 there, even if it's illegally occupied by endia, the people are Chinese 🇨🇳. And China 🇨🇳 should reclaim that! But, torturing your own people, in order to give message is not at all right and will tarnish China's 🇨🇳 image not just in the Critical countries but also in South Tibet... China 🇨🇳, we actually hope that you regain your lost people, your lost land..there are many people who love China 🇨🇳 in South Tibet... endia hasn't Fully succeeded in brainwashing the people... there's still chance but your action against your own people will make this closer to impossible which should not happen... Please, fight hard China 🇨🇳. We should kill endia, not Chinese 🇨🇳⚔️⚔️*"

Chinese baby snowboarder featured on Beijing 2022 opening ceremony,"No one will ever forget what China did worldwide. Where’s the honor for all those who passed, and r still compromised? Even millions of their own ppl. The world has no respect for a country that pays a trillion dollars on the Olympics to impress, but won’t offer all countries trillions for damages they incurred worldwide the past 2 years. U don’t get respect by showing off with visual effects at the Olympics. U gain worldwide respect when u own up to what u did and pay each country for it."
