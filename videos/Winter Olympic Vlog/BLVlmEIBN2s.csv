"Beijing 2022| Athletes laud Yanqing Zone services, facilities, hospitality| Winter Olympics","China is a cultural beggar. Little by little, they steal the culture of another country and put it on like rags.

China stole Korean culture. The top of the hanbok became shorter and shorter, and the present form was completed in the 19th century. This is evidence that China stole the clothing culture developed by Korea.

Mongolia's traditional clothes are also called the costumes of ethnic minorities in China.
According to China's logic, the world's traditional clothing belongs to the United States.
Of course, there is also the Chinese influence. However, it is Korea that independently developed it and made it into its present form.

China is ashamed of its own culture of bald and stealing the culture of neighboring countries.

Holding hands and dancing around in a circle is also 'ganggangsullae' and is a Korean culture. It is a Korean culture that has been registered with UNESCO.
The origin is that they hold hands and dance around a fire on the shore to make the number of Korean soldiers appear larger than the number of japanese soldiers.This dance on the brightest full moon day is also because it has to be seen by the Japanese military.

Korea's 'Samulnori' was also stolen.
Turning a hat with a long string is also Korean culture. It is registered in UNESCO. It is a Korean culture that participated in global events.

The 'janggu', which is an hourglass-shaped instrument lying on its side, is also a traditional Korean instrument. It has been proven that it is a Korean musical instrument as a relic that is older than the Chinese claim. (Mural paintings or dolls made of clay)

Among the foods, they stole kimchi and gimbap, and even stole Korean culture from various fields, from the traditional Korean game 'Yutnori' to the drumming dance 'Samgomu'.

BTS once decorated a stage with traditional Korean dances 'Samgomu' and 'Samulnori','Cheoyongmu' (dance with a mask and long cloth in hands)

During the Tiananmen Square incident, why does China burn all of its own culture and steal the culture of other countries?"
