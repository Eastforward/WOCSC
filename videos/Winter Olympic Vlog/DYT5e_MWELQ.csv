OLYMPICS VLOG || I WAS A VOLUNTEER FOR PYEONGCHANG 2018,"Hey! So happy that you were volunteer. I applied for Beijing 2022 but I have some questions what exactly means some locations which are in preference and abilities. Can you consult pleaaaseü•∫ü•∫ü•∫üôèüèª or can we change the choice or will everything be explained during the interview? That's my first and maybe the last time and i don't want to spoil anything
It would be very nice if you contacted me or shooted a video how to do this stuff"
OLYMPICS VLOG || I WAS A VOLUNTEER FOR PYEONGCHANG 2018,Hey! Did you have any special skills that might've helped you? I applied for Beijing 2022 and other than 4 languages that I speak I don't have anything special. I want the ice skating rink at all costs :/
