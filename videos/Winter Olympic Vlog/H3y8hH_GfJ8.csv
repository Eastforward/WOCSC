Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics Vlog & Seoul Airbnb Tour - Part 3 of 3 | KOREA TRAVEL VLOG,"Great vlogs! Makes me wish that I was there instead of watching them at home! Oh well, this was the next best thing, as I felt like I got a better feel of the environment there, a lot more so than what the TV could deliver. Now, I have to plan to visit the next Olympics. :) Can't imagine doing all of that, on such little sleep! I'll have to take a look at your videos when I get the chance!"
