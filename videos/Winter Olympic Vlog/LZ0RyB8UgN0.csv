A Different China At The 2022 Winter Olympics? | CNA Correspondent,Another English-speaking opinion outlet that focuses on the American political narrative...tiring
A Different China At The 2022 Winter Olympics? | CNA Correspondent,"China is a GLOBAL THREAT seeking world domination by flooding the world with the counterfeit product including $$$; their illegal build-up of artificial islands in the South China Sea; their unfettered ability to steal, rob, create, implement, release both technological apparatuses that have already infiltrated the USA, leading to both the indoctrination of our younger generations to using their smoke and mirror wealth to buy off, bribe, influence and cause-specific segments of the US Federal Government, persons at the highest levels to be indebted to them, beholden to them and basically serve as puppets for the XI puppet masters...From 5G technology, the younger generation is foolishly providing a permanent record of their entire life is being inventoried, and each person is being labeled, placed into the government-mandated categorization of every single person...not an opinion, that has publically proclaimed...Chinese Government and or their proxies, shells companies already comprise the largest group of private landowners in the United States...(let that sink in)...and for most who read this, your savior President of the US is nothing more than an errand boy, facilitator for these evil people as are so many within both political parties in the US 

*** Does anyone believe these Olympics were awarded to a country that indoctrinates each citizen to serve one entity-the state...family, friends, personal ambition, nurturing all are irrelevant...China steals technologies, they starve and torture their own citizens including mass executions...Government is in total control of everything...Yet, people in the US protest about being oppressed or singled out and targeted...spare me...less than 1% of those people have ever been outside their region of the US and certainly haven't seen and experienced what a Totalitarian-Socialists-Communist-Authoritarian Forms of government rolled up into one...and will have the Chinese Government...they are ruthless & as stated prior, along with Putin's objective to re-ratify or form the former USSR/Communist Party who has allied with Xi of China...the Soviets inserted the social implosion, cultural explosion of American values, Traditions and as stated and written about in the '60s, the 70s and 80s...ultimately being validated by a captured USSR spy who provided the literal playbook of how to destroy America without firing a shot...they put into place and began their plan that they estimated would take 20-30 years to come to fruition and it seems their objectives, step by step outline is nearing completion ...China today is even worse than what the German leaders evolved into in the late 30s and early 40s...and worse than what the Empire of Japan was prior to 1945... with America being at her weakest and most vulnerable...with compromised, cognitively challenged leaders with nothing relatable to the average American...not opinion, but the overwhelming verifiable fact of how the current American leaders are facilitating, empowering this murderous regime in achieving their objectives... I can not help but wonder if China would be ""hosting"" the Olympics if America had competent, cognitively aware, strong, pro-America, Pro Human Rights, Freedom-loving leaders...I don't believe any American would be there no matter how much money the IOC members were given, bribed, extorted for ""awarding' Bejing, China the Winter Olympics where there are NO mountains, No Snow, No Freedoms 

*** Every person attending whether a coach, journalist, athlete, etc all are demanded to install a specific app on all their devices...this is the country that leaked a biological weapon...do not be so naive to say otherwise...what will History expose about these times in 50yrs...I doubt much will align with the convictions so many have today... this weapon of war, chemical or biological weapon has already caused and they can release more that would do more immediate and short-term damage dropping 5 nuclear bombs on a country... You can be certain the Chinese Leadership NEVER experiences symptoms or could ever be infected by these viruses...If any think they are as vulnerable as any are not paying attention to the present or to history...For all those who attended that gloomy place, I pray every person is smart enough to be quarantined and carefully monitored upon returning ""home""...Perhaps more important is to make sure every digital device is thoroughly tested, cleaned or I would suggest, highly recommend for their safety and that of their country and the worlds that before they even traveled to China they realized these possibilities and only took a burner device...something with zero sensitive information and be prepared to discard it before leaving the country...any who take these devices ""home"" are risking unleashing the potential next ""step"" in China's overall objectives... For those on the left, do not be concerned, your politicians will continue to miraculously win elections and have so-called power...but in reality, I think most of us recognize who is truly in control...and it's not an American... I would be shocked if any politician opposing China with action will be elected or should say will serve again unless America still is capable.

 *** For any younger than 50 yrs old...PLEASE READ, LISTEN TO ""THE SPEECH""... or its Official Title, ""A TIME FOR CHOOSING""...although he made numerous valid and relevant points even today..in fact, I would argue more relevant today than even the day he gave it....one of the best lines in the speech by the man who would become arguably one of the greatest presidents in American History...He defined the left, Democrats, Liberals in a perfect way... *** ""...our liberal friends...is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so...""  Future President Reagan(at that time) went on to describe in fascinating detail exactly what has happened IF...except when he stated things he used the words IF or WILL Happen...vs are happening... and as Reagan ended this speech by stating if we are not willing to do what needs to be done...and it is obvious those in so-called power today do not have the best interest of America at the forefront of their minds

*** ""...We'll (EITHER) preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth (MEANING AMERICAN VALUES, TRADITIONS, LAWS, CONSTITUTION, FREEDOMS, AND RIGHTS), or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness..."" (In essence stating, if America falls within 1-2 generations, even if it's subtly done and not by armies...Americans will reach the point where their own children will be born into a society that is controlled entirely by the government and the child will forever be without any freedoms, rights, ability to make a decision, fulfill a desire, a dream...they will forever be enslaved...If anyone thinks I am over the top I only ask before reaching such a conclusion to take time to learn history...not 50-100-150 yrs ago...but 1000s of years...learn about the empires, the most powerful during different ages...America is close to losing its grip on being a true SuperPower...although America has faults...there is no better place or proven form of Government IF THE GOVERNMENT WILL recognize they have become what our founding fathers warned us against, did everything they could, spelled it out on how to avoid becoming the property of the state...even so, over time, primarily the left, the Dems have pushed America closer to the edge of the abyss...and when we collapse...those who protested, cursed and made irrational, rush conclusions will be screaming for help from those they ridiculed, refused to support and in fact did everything in their power to destroy... it will be too late then...whether you experience in your lifetime or not...if America stays on this heading, this course, either you or your kids will live to experience losing their last civil right, human right...and they will be forced to bow, take a knee before the government or be eliminated...I will never take a knee...but many wills... I just hate the world as a whole is headed on a collision course...unless deviation occurs...and China is the TRAIN HEADED DIRECTLY AT THE REST OF US...

*** President Reagan stated in THE SPEECH things relevant today about welfare, socialism, Big Government, the loss of individual rights...He spoke about Regimes like the USSR and this applies to China today...President Reagan stated, ""... EACH OF US, EVERY AMERICAN MUST FIND, CREATE AND/OR HAVE THE courage to say to our enemies, ""There is a price we will not pay."" ""There is a point beyond which they must not advance."" And this - this is the meaning OF ... ""peace through strength.""...  Winston Churchill said, ""The destiny of man is not measured by material computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits - not animals...There's something going on... in time and space and beyond time and space... which... whether we like it or not... spells DUTY.""...MEANING DUTY TO COUNTRY...MEANING, WE FACE RIDICULE AND CHASTISING, LIES AND MISINFORMATION...WE STAND UP AGAINST THOSE WHO OPPOSE OUR RIGHTS...AND IF THE DAY ARISES WHERE FORCE MUST BE MET WITH FORCE THEN SO BE IT...BUT IT IS AMERICANS OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE...TO DEFEND, FIGHT AND BE WILLING TO DIE IF NECESSARY...to sacrifice everything to protect America's Freedoms...because once America falls...once America is fully under the control of another regime as we are much closer to than what majority of the lay public realize...if America falls into the abyss there is no other place to go...no other places to escape to or to run to...  I sincerely pray we are not already past the line or point of no return...
