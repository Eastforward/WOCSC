Yet even if that doesn't happen the seed been planted that so many positive or not that many blatantly negative comments you reach a conclusion they were not bad...China did a decent job considering you know what that THEY CREATED AND UNLEASHED ON THE ENTIRE WORLD...Their people are slaves to their Government...and you are reading and seeing and perhaps replying to or having someone replying to you that must do this...12-18hrs a day or if they fail to do so they are imprisoned, beaten or worse...most are probably people who for whatever reason can not be involved in the manual workforce...too old, too young, pregnant, auto-immune diseases, broken leg, etc...you can think of a few... The point is, the CHINESE GVT is filing up message boards, comment sections... \n\nThat's the blessing or the curse of the internet ...particularly for the average person, \"layman\"... even with a VPN they have a false sense of security they are not being monitored, their comments are totally made with anonymity...PLEASE DO NOT BE THAT NAIVE... If you posted a specific word, phrase, etc...agencies from all over including the US will know your name, every account you have, every password and have a complete backup of your data within 5 minutes max...if interested enough, even if power-off the device or computer if it has a Mic and built-in camera it can be turned on...literally looking at you...definitely has your location...not just address but which room you are in, what wall closest too...people have no idea...all I can say or will....", "parentId": "Ugzy947GbrZWXxxAWbd4AaABAg", "authorDisplayName": "OSCAR MIKE", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR6swc3TtnSZkVrgIMlHqs6Rk_LqIZADwvVtROzzd8=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCee7AF0Zsa0bybsRcWRVKSQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCee7AF0Zsa0bybsRcWRVKSQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-02-10T08:44:34Z", "updatedAt": "2022-02-10T08:44:34Z"}}]}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "a4oMkro2W4KMw1BXX8kRVPJYlMc", "id": "UgxipY_Hv9kr2RFP0Rp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "LZ0RyB8UgN0", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "o0HZ73yTgK9h-hFyAct3PVy17iY", "id": "UgxipY_Hv9kr2RFP0Rp4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "LZ0RyB8UgN0", "textDisplay": "Its not an olimpic ...sucios les importa mas los resultados que el orgullo", "textOriginal": "Its not an olimpic ...sucios les importa mas los resultados que el orgullo", "authorDisplayName": "\ubc15\ud574\ubbfc", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS4NYohaIzm8VeePLKgqoPK-PNRsgQTbSBJbA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtW6DwOE_5h8qDRO_960JjA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCtW6DwOE_5h8qDRO_960JjA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-02-09T11:50:03Z", "updatedAt": "2022-02-09T11:50:03Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "FVNCNYoA7isuEzi-E2WbxseXe1Q", "id": "UgzC80T9k9OfmmBecG54AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "LZ0RyB8UgN0", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "H-6w3z4pPY7QYaKf63KKZHL7RYo", "id": "UgzC80T9k9OfmmBecG54AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "LZ0RyB8UgN0", "textDisplay": "XIjinping let a mere Uyghur participate in his propaganda show!
