🔥 GOING TO THE OLYMPICS!!! 🔥 #beijing2022,"The Most Crooked Olympics Ever in History!! China, IOC and judges should be investigated for bribery. They are giving unfair/false penalties to other country athletes so that China could advance to the final, Disgusting!! Watch the Chinese skater literally pulled the Hungarian skater in Short track final but the Hungarian skater got the penalty and Chinese got Gold. Totally insane and disgusting!! And this is just one example of many."

You represented the maple leaf  with poise, pride, professionalism and a big heart. I know it might not have been the performances you planned but I hope you still got something from the experience. You always kept your head up, got back up and finished your routines and that's what matters. I can't wait to follow you on social media and see where your adventures in figure skating take you next 🇨🇦👏"
