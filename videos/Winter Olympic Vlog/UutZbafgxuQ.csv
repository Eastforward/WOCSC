"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!","Ok I'm behind on vlogs AGAIN, but anyways. My husband has a Star Wars Lego addiction he's tackled the Republic Gunship it only had 1194pcs. His Goliath that he dreams of is the new Millennium Falcon of 7541pcs.!!!! Finding places for them all after has been our problem he never likes what we come up with."

"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!",I would love the Disney box!
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!",The makeup is very nice. You look pretty with and without the makeup. üòÄ. The meals you make always look good. Good to see you and Mike having fun with legos üíú
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!","I got that Cactuspen once for my birthday I think. Don't know where it is now, lost it somewhere during a move. It's a nice little gadget to have on a desk. :) Love all the cacti stuff to be honest....you're getting me all into them as well haha :p I'm converted :p
Building lego together is so much fun, isn't it? We have the Apollo Saturn V too and we have the Disney castle! The castle took us about a week, but if you can build from the morning till the evening, you'll probably get it done on 2 or 3 days :) It was so much fun though! Oh and I've got Lego Wall-E too. He is so cute!
Aw man, that troll life :p I knew he was going to move the chair when he was watching Foster drink. I was yelling at my screen like: no wait, Liz, Mike's gonna troll ya too with the chair! :p But yelling from present to past, from Belgium to the US....that's pretty hard, so you probably didn't hear me haha :p"
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!",I love Ulta they have everything and then some!
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!","Omg, you need to make a meme of Colby waiting for dinne, it is so perfect. I hope you enjoyed the Houston BBQ/rodeo. The family is heading down there next week to see it. Btw, I say ""pin"" instead of ""pen"" so you are not alone, lol üòÄ I love your planner montage and I am planner girl myself and found an awesome YT channel, @mrsmomnextdoor, who does weekly spreads and they are so pretty!"
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!",That week of rain we had was awful. I‚Äôm ready for the sun. I knew nothing about Torchy‚Äôs until we moved to the Arlington area 2 years ago. It‚Äôs amazing! All the events here are huge- we went to the state fair in Dallas last year and it was unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced (weird fried foods). Disney box please
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!","Lip colour looks good for sure! The shadows looked really nice too :)

"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!",Neat makeup. I have started getting back into makeup again since I have discovered that a couple of the drugstores have their own (affordable) brands. It's a fun and cheap way to try something new. I have also been watching some tutorials so that I have a clue about how to put it all on! That lipstick and eyeliner looked cute on you. üòÄ
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!","I wish the girl guides of Canada would import the cookies that the Americans get:(¬† I am actually doing a presentation of my Disney pin collection to¬†a local girl guide troop.¬† I was showing off my collection at work one day and one of my co-workers was amazed at the collection and wanted me to present them to the girls.¬† I'll just have to pat them down at the end of the presentation;)¬† Congrats on winning gold in women's hockey!¬† I love Virtue and Moir!¬† Hope to see them live one day.....¬† I am rooting for Joe ""the bear"" to win Top Chef."

"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!","I do PLAY! by Sephora. It's monthly like Ipsy. $10 a month. I enjoy it if ever you decide to give that one a go. It comes monthly in a pouch, with a description & instructions on each product. Plus you get a 50 beauty insider points for your card every month if you purchase something online or in the store. Not sure if youre getting another Dia&Co box, but thanks to you, I got two already and absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) Its cool having someone help me with trendy clothes and help me with styling. That's so cool that you and Mike did the Lego kit. I cant wait to see the Launch one! Also I do appreciate the light tests ... I've been toying with getting lights too for when I do unboxing videos & I'm thinking of starting to sell Paparazzi Jewelry, which I'll need lights for that too. lol Did you ever get to check out Pier one imports for Cacti items? I think they are on sale or clearance now... Check it out if you haven't.  ANDDDDDDDD, I was DYYYYYYING laughing with the Mike Troll Montague. Back and forth with that chair... I was cracking up. You guys are just tooooo funny! (Disney Box)"
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!","Ash looked so confused by mike‚Äôs extended chair trolling lol. And I was so excited about Virtue and Moir winning but i wasn‚Äôt really surprised considering they have won the olympics before and it wasn‚Äôt nearly as exciting as the hockey, especially since I love hockey. (And entry to the sci-Fi box please and thank you)"
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!",I loooove BNL! We put together the Disney castle on Christmas a year ago and it took the 4 of us 13 hours and I cried from frustration at one point... but it was a lot of fun!
"WEEKLY VLOG #7: Cacti Haul, Doctor Who Legos, and More Winter Olympics!",that Lego set is awesome!  And nice to see Mike in top trolling form  üòÅ ... Congrats on winning gold in hockey!!!  How crazy were those shootouts!!
