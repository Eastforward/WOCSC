It&#39;s monthly like Ipsy. $10 a month. I enjoy it if ever you decide to give that one a go. It comes monthly in a pouch, with a description &amp; instructions on each product. Plus you get a 50 beauty insider points for your card every month if you purchase something online or in the store. Not sure if youre getting another Dia&amp;Co box, but thanks to you, I got two already and absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) Its cool having someone help me with trendy clothes and help me with styling. That&#39;s so cool that you and Mike did the Lego kit. I cant wait to see the Launch one! Also I do appreciate the light tests ... I&#39;ve been toying with getting lights too for when I do unboxing videos &amp; I&#39;m thinking of starting to sell Paparazzi Jewelry, which I&#39;ll need lights for that too. lol Did you ever get to check out Pier one imports for Cacti items? I think they are on sale or clearance now... Check it out if you haven&#39;t.  ANDDDDDDDD, I was DYYYYYYING laughing with the Mike Troll Montague. Back and forth with that chair... I was cracking up.
