Did China Give This AWESOME Winter Olympics 2022 Gift Bag?,Dont just think they're only free boring gifts . Theres also good service there. Theres only things u cant think of but nothing that china cant do. The players dont go there for free gifts they're there for a reason. And instead of criticising china getting credit or just your prejudice. Why not u think about how china never start a fight unless they started it first. Plus china welcomed other people warmly and kindly but still no one ever looked or tried to get to know china.
