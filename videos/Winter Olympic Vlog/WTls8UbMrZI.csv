Global sponsors quiet ahead of Beijing Winter Olympics - BBC News,"Complaints about the food inside the ""closed loop"" have been mounting, with athletes, media and other personnel posting on social media about the lack of quality, variety, or healthy choices at the available restaurants, including the canteen at the Main Media Centre (MMC). One hotel manager even admitted to CNN that the food in one of their own restaurants is “disgusting.” Fresh fruit is hard to find, and no snack items or hot food are allowed to be delivered to guests into the bubble from outside. The only shop in the MMC sells low-quality packaged snacks, a small number of toiletry items, and Chinese beer – and the shelves are often half-empty. Those who were able to visit Beijing before the pandemic have lamented their disappointment about the poor choices available in a city that is famous for its excellent food. Even the much-touted, robot-powered restaurant at the MMC is often overcrowded with people taking videos for social media, and they warn customers that it could take 40 minutes to be served. And despite the robot-powered food delivery system – which lowers plates of food via a wire from purple pods that slide along the ceiling – the rest of the operation still runs in a far less futuristic way, with customers paying in cash or credit card at the till and staff in some sections hand-delivering the trays of lukewarm dumplings that were made by the robots. The robot cocktail bar is often closed, and on several visits, the machines had run out of ingredients, so the staff on site reverted to making the drinks the old-fashioned way. The dinner buffet at the Shangri-La Hotel – which includes good quality Chinese dishes and international options – and the restaurant at the Marco Polo Hotel are among the only places inside the ""closed loop"" escaping major criticism of their food. But they come at a cost -- notably a price tag of more than $60 per head for the Shangri-La buffet."

Global sponsors quiet ahead of Beijing Winter Olympics - BBC News,"BIDEN (et ses alliés) est déclaré Persona Non Grata aux JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022. Les pays participants du boycott diplomatique sont marginalisés. Ils se comptent avec les doigts d'une main. Une trentaine de Chefs d'Etat et de Gouvernement sont présents à la Tribune des JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022. Poutine en est la vedette. Sont présents à la Tribune: le Secrétaire Général des Nations Unies, le Grand Duc Henri du Luxembourg, le Prince Albert II de Monaco, le Président de la Pologne et le Président de la Serbie. Aux JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022 la Chine et la Russie s'affichent ensemble pour montrer le nouvel ordre mondial. Sans BIDEN. La Russie a reçu le soutien de la Chine en ce qui concerne les préoccupations raisonnables de la Russie. La Russie et la Chine s'opposent à l'expansion future de l'OTAN. L'occident doit empêcher l'humoriste d'Ukraine d'allumer le feu de la troisième guerre mondiale. Un ouïghour porte la flamme olympique pour dénoncer les tissus de mensonge occidentaux sur les ouïghours. Un coup de pied au cul des journalistes des télévisions menteuses occidentales. Une paire de gifles aux députés français votant la résolution sur les ouïghours.-

BIDEN (and his allies) is declared Persona Non Grata at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The countries participating in the diplomatic boycott are marginalized. They can be counted with the fingers of one hand. About thirty Heads of State and Government are present at the Tribune of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Putin is the star. Present at the Tribune are: Secretary-General of the United Nations, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Prince Albert II of Monaco, the President of Poland and the President of Serbia. At the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, China and Russia are coming together to show the new world order. Without BIDEN. Russia has received China's support regarding Russia's reasonable concerns. Russia and China oppose NATO's future expansion. The West must prevent the comedian from Ukraine from lighting the fire of World War III. A Uyghur carries the Olympic flame to denounce Western fabrics of lies about Uighurs. A kick in the ass of Western lying TV journalists. A pair of slaps to French MPs voting for the resolution on the Uyghurs.!!"
Global sponsors quiet ahead of Beijing Winter Olympics - BBC News,"There were a few  countries boycotting the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics game, based on the excuses of their forged Xingjiang stories, claiming the Xinjiang ISIS members lost their human rights of killing others, while more than 160 courtiers supporting the world humanity unity event."

Global sponsors quiet ahead of Beijing Winter Olympics - BBC News,Look at all the Wumao posting on this article. The CCP pays them cents per post that is how desperate the CCP is to stiffle criticism. These Olympics will be the least watched gloablly around the world. The people on the mainland will be forced to watch events that they don't really understand just to cheer on the national team.
