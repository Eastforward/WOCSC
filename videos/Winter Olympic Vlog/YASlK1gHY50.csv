Beijing Olympic Games Vlog (2) - How an athlete actually lives at the Olympics,"I don't know your political leaning. However, the fact that you are from the ""free world"" undoubtedly tinted your own perception of your commentary. There are a few unfortunate facts you need to take into account when you are taking issues with the tight security and controls of the surroundings.
(1). China being what it is, a system that is very different to Denmark which you are accustomed to,
(2). Covid. That is self-explanatory. It is China's responsibility to ensure that you are not infectious to others, and equally important, you are not infected because of the Olympics.
(3). Terrorist attacks. Such is event is a honeypot for terrorists to score a publicity victory. There were precedents before if you care to check it up yourself. Paradoxically, your country is among the Western nations to accuse China of oppression to certain groups, yet they are the likely people to wish you harm to get the attentions they craved.
(4). Broadcasting rights. I am no expert in such a field, I have no comments.

It would be nice to see it from the other side for a change. Well, I do give you credit for not bitching and moaning about the foods. I noticed the Korean team is really good at such craft. Perhaps it reflects on their national inadequacy, or it might be superiority ? Either way, it is rude to have a go at your host. You don't piss on your host."
