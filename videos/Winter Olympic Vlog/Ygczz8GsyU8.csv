Winter Olympics 2018 || Opening Ceremonies from the athlete's perspective || David Wise,"Loved your video! I was wondering how athletes spent their time during the Olympics and your videos told everything! I hope to see you and other freestyle skiers more outside of the game so I can get to know you guys better- eye masks are too big to tell who is who in the game! Also, I can't wait to see your run in the halfpipe final. I know you will enjoy and ace it! : )"
