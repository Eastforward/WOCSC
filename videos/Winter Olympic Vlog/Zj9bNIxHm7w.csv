Journalists embark upon 'Olympic sport' of closed loop transportation,"stop the dramas. it's rules agreed between IOC and chinese govt that all atheletes, journalists, chinese volunteers stay inside the loop for the entire period of the olympic. if u want to exit the loop, u have to be in quarantine 14+7 days. then u can visit anywhere in china. 

every inbound travellers to china have been subjected to the same rules since summer 2020. even all famous hong kong female singer GEM ( she has at least 100 million fans in mainland china) followed the same quarantine rules.

and china doesnt just put winter olympic events inside the close loops. all chinese int'l airports that takes int'l inbound travellers have been putting inside their own close loops since summer 2020. chinese pilots, flight attendants, airport workers, custom officers, immigrantion officers all live in dorms or airport hotels inside their close loops. they stay inside the loop at least 3 months per shift and cant go home. before exiting the loop, they also have to follow 14+7 days quarantine rules. 

so many chinese volunteers sacrifice their own freedom and endure so much inconvenience to ensure a safe and successful olympic during the pandemic. i think that's something u should report."
