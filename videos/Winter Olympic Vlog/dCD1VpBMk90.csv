Solo Winter Camping in my Jeep During a Snow Storm,I don’t understand how someone can steal from a guy like you. All you do is make amazing content for your followers and live life to the fullest. I’m sorry that happened to you man. Keep your head high and I bet you’ll bounce back and come back greater than ever.
Solo Winter Camping in my Jeep During a Snow Storm,"As someone who once had an outdoor YouTube channel, I can truly appreciate this video. I know all the work that goes into filming and editing and you have done a magnificent job at both. Setting up the camera then back tracking so you can drive by your camera is extremely time consuming. The drone footage is absolutely stunningly beautiful!!! I also enjoyed watching your adventure. I'm trading in my 2018 Z71 Colorado for a 2022 Tacoma TRD Pro. It will be my daily driver, but, also going to make it into a mild overlander rig. Would appreciate info on your roof top canopy, looked pretty cool. As I said, I once had a YouTube channel (Grey Wolfe Outdoors) and now that Im retired I will probably be starting it back up again. Thank you for taking the time to film, edit, and share this video."
