Men's Halfpipe TEAM USA Press Conference Q&A || Winter Olympics Beijing 2022 Vlog,I’m only gonna watch the Olympics through your videos . Maybe a sad thing to say especially because in the past I’ve been a great fan of the Olympics. I’m not a praying man but I’ll pray that your safe and you hit your human potential and beyond in-these Olympics. I’ll add these prayers after I pray for my friends up north (Canadian freedom rallies) Good luck from North Idaho..
