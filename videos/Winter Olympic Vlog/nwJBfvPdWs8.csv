"Beijing Olympics Postponed: So, I explore the city","Actually using artificial snow is essential and just norm for winter Olympics (not a new thing...) But now become a wrong doing for Beijing ....
Also, the cooler tower behind the stage is not a nuclear plant ... but just a steel mill closed 10 years ago and transformed into a leisure and cultural area."

"Beijing Olympics Postponed: So, I explore the city",Why the weston medias are always so mean and trivial. Beijing winter Olympic is still the most successful winter sport event historically even without real snow. Who cares the snow is real or man-made as long as the athletes enjoy and feel safe and comfortable. Keep in mind even a powerful country like China is not able control the weather.

"Beijing Olympics Postponed: So, I explore the city","too much negative news about the olympics here in canada. i think sports and politics should be mutually exclusive. ancient greeks would stop conflicts to host the games, here we are in the 21st century and mixing sports and politics together. what a shame !!!! love from canada."
