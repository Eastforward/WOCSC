welcome to this week's pascal's channels we're going to talk about the winter olympic games in china in beijing starting february ...,"Over the past one and a half decade I have seen the worst sides of the Western countries, particularly the US. Through my past official dealing with the US law enforcement and intelligence agencies, I really feel lucky not being an American. I cannot help but to conclude that the US is nothing but a giant factory of lies and the most dictatorship-styled country. Beside being a fake democracy with questionable human rights, The US is also an arrogant warlord. 

Look at the racial discrimination between the whites and other non whites, where is the real equal rights? 

The politicians are even given the legal green lights to accept bribes from interest groups or lobbyists in the name of political donations. 

Some may have forgotten that the US lied to the world that Saddam Hussain had several arsenal of weapons of mass destruction hidden in Iraq to justify its invasion into Iraq. BUT, in the end, there was no evidence of such claims to be found!

Above are just some glimpses of evil things that were done by the US.

Recent years, I see that lots of western medias started to deviate from reporting facts to writing fictions. These rogue medias claim to monitor the governments. However, who monitor them? Is there any way to bring these rogue medias to court for defaming a country, an organization or an individual?"
