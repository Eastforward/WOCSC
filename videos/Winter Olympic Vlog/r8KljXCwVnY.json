My point is, that if we accept that the games are 100% green as China and ICO claims, then we can use China as a reference for future games and learn from them. If we claim the games are not green at all, then there will be no incentive to make an effort next time in Italy in 2026. Our trust in China will define our intensions for the future to save the planet. I trust the Beijing games are green, because I recognise that China has the renewable energy capacity to make 100% green games and are planting millions of trees to make up for the CO2. I believe the western media is correct to point out that artificial snow is not ecological, but it is not helpful to attack China as their efforts to make the games green are real.", "parentId": "Ugzil0FaFmtfHkw7cW94AaABAg", "authorDisplayName": "Pascal Coppens", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTQW6XLYWKXd3jiVEAlLRpwI1qsZt3P5UUZ1CLPIg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTdWsl15oEt0nZZy9Z1fnhQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTdWsl15oEt0nZZy9Z1fnhQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2022-02-13T07:31:34Z", "updatedAt": "2022-02-13T07:31:34Z"}}]}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "v91XhGTyTY_f7e9t3ACdwIVSa9I", "id": "Ugz6ur0Cms7thuhwR9V4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "r8KljXCwVnY", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "jXylvg5s6BDYAFJvQ6nYQuwx4zc", "id": "Ugz6ur0Cms7thuhwR9V4AaABAg", "snippet": {"videoId": "r8KljXCwVnY", "textDisplay": "Actually, we are enjoying more because of all those jealousness from the West.
