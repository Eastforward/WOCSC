Olympics here I come!,Foreign athletes should speak up since they are finally in China to see the real truth for themselves. They should let the world know how they have been lied by their U S gov snd media like how they were lied about the weapon of mass destruction in the Middle East that helped the U S killed millions of people in the region. Speaking up will save lives and prevent unnecessary wars. Going against the western narrative may look un cool but God will be proud. The right thing is never easy but it is the right thing to do.
