Eileen Gu Competes for China Explained : Beijing 2022,"Anyone born in the US with one or both parents with a foreign nationality(nationalities) automatically receives an American nationality until they turn adults, then they get to choose their own nationality, it is that simple. Family-wise, Eileen Gu was raised by her mom and grandma as a sole-parent family and solely influenced by her Chinese family and soaked with Chinese culture. Therefore, no matter how many more environmental factors there are around her in her external life, she will reasonably recognize herself more as a Chinese girl, there is nothing too surprising."

Eileen Gu Competes for China Explained : Beijing 2022,"My biggest question isâ€¦.where will she live moving forward?  Is she going to try and come back to the USA?  At the end of the day it is definitely her free choice, but some decisions have MAJOR consequences, as she is swiftly learning.

The biggest issue is her choosing to support a communist government that oppresses her people the way China does.  Very sad."
Eileen Gu Competes for China Explained : Beijing 2022,Can anyone with a parent from China pick up a second passport then ? There is a lot confusion here.
Eileen Gu Competes for China Explained : Beijing 2022,Shes in the news becous vpn is on the appstore ;) And she cant really compete for china becous she has a American sitizenship. But CCP needs her for propaganda so she got the green card.
Eileen Gu Competes for China Explained : Beijing 2022,"Once everything is done, Eileen Gu will go home to US and hang the gold medal on her wall and I bet she will never think of being a chinese citizen for even 1 second. Why would anyone want to emigrate to china? It's the other way around. Even CCP members want to move to US if they can... if they can figure out a way to take their money out of China."

Eileen Gu Competes for China Explained : Beijing 2022,The only issue is that China denies duel citizenship.
Eileen Gu Competes for China Explained : Beijing 2022,She has been representing China since 2019.
Eileen Gu Competes for China Explained : Beijing 2022,"Ultimately, the decision lies with the athlete, No one disputes that Eileen was born and raised in the US, enjoying all the privileges of what America can offer, good coaches, training venues, sporting opportunities, etc decide to compete for China. That is her right. She is a personable young woman, a well-grounded teenager, she is living the life, with sponsors like Louis Vitton, Tiffany, etc, she gets to travel freely, go to the best school. Her noble ambition is to inspire young people in China to take up skiing and set up herself as the poster girl and inspiration. All well and good. But there is one factor that comes with her move. She is giving credibility to the Communist Regime and Xi Jinping's CCP, which carries out genocide, organ harvesting, brutalizes races that it deems inferior, brutalizes its own people that don't toe the line. This regime glorifies winners and bullies and torments and mocks failures. Her reasons for joining China seem noble and well intended, but with it comes the perception, she is endorsing, supporting, and crediting the CCP and Xi Jinping, Her mother with strong ties to the CCP also doesn't hurt.
    Are Louis Vitton and Tiffany comfortable with the knowledge that their girl is supporting, endorsing, and have close ties with Xi and CCP? What will the world think of them with this knowledge?"
Eileen Gu Competes for China Explained : Beijing 2022,I was def bothered by her decision not to represent the country thatâ€™s given her everything but the point you made about her inspiring millions of young people in China is a great one.
