GLOBALink | Vlog: The historic firsts in Beijing Winter Olympics venues,"For those who refuse to watch the Olympics games, don’t worry, the games will be unwatchable anyway. NBC will broadcast the games in 480p resolution video, will use grey filters for all scenery and will use Photoshop program to make images grey."
GLOBALink | Vlog: The historic firsts in Beijing Winter Olympics venues,"Yes, using carbon dioxide may be more environmentally friendly, but if it leaks out it could kill. Having said that, China is by far the best country to host Olympic Games now and in the future. It is one country that can guarantee all facilities, world first class facilities,  are completed and ready way ahead of time.
All the best to Beijing Olympics!!!"
