Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,The Olympics should be fair and should keeps its integrity.
Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,"I don't really understand why everyone is so mad, to be honest. The investigation has not been completed yet, so it is not known whether Valieva is guilty or not. These analyses and legal issues will be dealt with over the next months and only then will we know the truth. Valieva should take part in the competition, and if she is found guilty, the medals will be awarded to other prize-winners. If she is not guilty, then the reward will rightfully remain with her. In my opinion, it is absurd not to allow Kamila to participate in the Olympics when the investigation has not been completed."

Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,"Time to do away with these Olympics, they suck and no longer bring any pleasure."
Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,"Kamila left all emotions on the ice and took the lead in the short program.  ‚ô•Ô∏è Russian figure skaters are not subject to pressure. The Olympic Games in Beijing, which our skaters have been dreaming about for the past four years, have turned from a holiday into a nightmare.  ü•∫"
Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,What y‚Äôall mad about ? She is skating clean at the games and her new tests are clean what‚Äôs the issue? She came out positive months ago and she would have still made the roc team without the drugs. People are acting as if she still have drugs in her system.  Sorry but she is too far ahead of the rest of the girls. She doesn‚Äôt need drugs to cheat . This is just pure jealousy. It‚Äôs a damn heart medication y‚Äôall acting like it‚Äôs some hardcore drugs

Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,"Yes, she's only 15. But she should know better than that. Valieva, don't you feel ashamed to be part of the competition? Because I do. IOC is punishing the REAL medalists because of her. WOW."
Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,"the timing is impeccable.

corrupted WADA attempt to sabotage her just in time after she got gold medal and hours before team medals ceremony was held.

imagine you are clean 2 months before olympics, then before and during Beijing olympics and suddenly you are not.

this is just another SJW witch hunt.

USA really doesn't want to see Russia in olympics.

Beijing olympics officials decided she is clean before and during the event and may resume her competition.

the arbitrary court decided she can resume her competition and rejected WADA, IOC and friends for her suspension.

WADA failed to deliver the ""positive"" doping result which was ""negative"", it took them two months and they waited for the athlete to get gold medal and her team to win the team event before they deliver the ""positive"" result.

the arbitrary court literally call WADA incompetent for their job.

WADA use ""COVID and lack of staff"" as an excuse for their incompetent.

and WADA didn't defend themselves, they settled being called incompetent rather than called for attempt on sabotage of an athlete.

WADA doesn't want to get investigated by any chance if Russia sue them for sabotage attempt on Kamila Valieva. (which Russia should) so WADA stay put.

WADA attempt on the sabotage failed, leaving only IOC (International olympics comittee) and friends.

IOC and friends didn't stop there, they still fighting not to give medals so they came up with this.

half of the olympics sponsors are US companies: Visa, Airbnb, Proctor & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and with the last one, Intel Corp."

Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,"Lol ya""ll calling her cheater, but you don't realize she has no competition from outside countries, only her domestic rivals, she is that good and doesnt need any boosters to win an olympic gold, so her doping incident must be accident not intentional, btw it was couple months ago now her system is clean, you guys do not realize she is the talent born once in a decade."
Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,"O, heahh! She is piece of ..."
Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,"I don't get it. So one athlete cheats, and less is punished? What about all the CLEAN athletes who tried their best for this Olympic game? The IOC needs to admit that to be fair for every athlete, she shouldn't have been qualified. They are messing up the Olympic games"
Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,Even if she gets disqualified it warms my heart knowing no medals will go to the USA since they perform so bad in women's FS.
Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,"""we're trying to buy some time until we can figure out a way to award the medal to her on technicality"""
Winter Olympics: IOC will not award medals if Kamila Valieva finishes in top three,Why should other CLEAN athletes be robbed of their olympic experience to accommodate a cheater?
