"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move","5:32 stop here a second woman. If ""Uighur genocide"" is a fact, you should see Uighurs rush to the neighboring countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakstan... There are five ""-stan"" countries bordering Xinjiang. The five countries are Muslim, and the Uighurs are Muslim. Do you believe none of the five countries cares about China killing their Muslim brothers? Why did their presidents attend Beijing Winter Olympics Ceremony? If westerners really care about Muslim people, they should give Afghans' money back cuz they are starving, especially children and women there. Seizing their money is immoral."
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",Very perfectly decision bravo 🇺🇸
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",Boycott Olympics but not Chimese goods ok got it!!!!
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move","How hypocritical of the U.S. to criticize China and these Olympic games over what we call human rights abuses while sending our athletes. We utilized torture during the Iraq war we started based on lies we didn't bother to fully investigate because it would take too long! Gee I guess torture isn't abusing human rights. Wow torture doesn't work we found out! Fancy that! We don't go around with heads bowed in shame we approved it! In 1941 we interned Japanese-Americans using racism as an excuse. Whole families! We didn't say gee y'know this violates human rights being blamed for Pearl Harbor Japanese-Americans had no part in! We had slavery! Nothing like thinking we could own others to violate human rights! We interned in cages and still have them there, of immigrants we call illegal who had the right to escape violence and poverty! When our ancestors came from other countries we didn't write letters asking permission! You can't own a country! Children were separated and not all have been recovered! These immigrants haven't been vaccinated against Covid. So putting people in cages isn't violating human rights? We have endless gun violence in this country! Sorry! I don't think it's a right to own a gun so you can use it for any excuse! Shooting people isn't a violation of human rights especially in school shootings we look at as NORMAL now? We have Islamophobia using 9/11 as an excuse! Nothing like violating human rights hating you for your religion terrorists you don't know twist! We have Asian-American violence! The continuation of anti semitism in America! Human rights be damned hating because of race and religion mistaken for a race! We sell arms! Yeah right! Selling weapons for other people's wars doesn't seem a violation of human rights killing and destroying! We profit off war! Diplomacy takes too long! Anti vaxxers who refuse to vax and boost furthuring the spread of Covid violates human rights by infection and death! They don't see a problem with selfishness! We have voter suppression and white supremist groups we let wander around both violating human rights to participate in politics and roaming around in hate groups calling their hate ""freedom of speech"" until someone gets hurt or killed of course! We stole Indian lands! Violated treaties! Made war on them! Put people on reservations to starve and on reservations today there's poverty and alcoholism! So it's not violating human rights to force you off your own land and fight against you because you dared to try to keep what was yours?  So tell me! How dare WE condemn whatever human rights violations China does, so self-righteously sanctimonious when the U.S. isn't as spotless new fallen snow! We've shown cruelty to others without remorse to our own and others and we hate being reminded of our own human rights violations! Amazing how we recognize human rights violations against others while refusing to stop doing it ourselves feeling we're the exception to the rules!"
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move","If China had proportionally as many in prison as the US does it would 
have OVER 10 MILLION.  It actually has 1.7 million. The US has 2.3 
million."
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",Nothing get destroy in internet unlike traditional newspaper. Diplomatic boycott China Olympics while sending diplomats and doubling them every week to China. What kind of US diplomatic boycott voodoo is this?
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",Do you think theses world leaders or diplomats care anything about the suffering of people in another country when they don't care for the people suffering in their own countries! Its all about the money. And the athletes don't care either because they themselves have selfish interest!
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",This lady has know clue wear she is > >??? seems lost ..
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",Boycott china
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move","Whats the benefit of a boycot when the whole world sees the oppression of the Muslims and Christians in China but there's no action from the u.s. or un, it's a joke, they refrain from sending government officials but still send athletes into a country where they so called complain about the treatment of its people."
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move","On doit savoir le vrai pourquoi
Pourquoi soudain 
On boycotte ces jeux 
Simplement 
1. Ultra moderne, robotique , complètement en sûreté 
2. Regardez Philadelphia, les alcooliques, les  Stupéfiés. La poubelle partout

PLUTOT BOURREAUX 
4. SVP veillez faire une petite récréation à Sydney 
Partout des sinistrés,  des alcooliques, un

Chers messieurs mesdames 
En Australie ce qu’on fait avec les DELINQUENTS ON LES EXCLUT DE LA SOCIETE 
PAR CONTRE 
Moi j’en ai rencontré ces vrais délinquants Uighur
Ça ne se trouve pas seulement à Urumuchi 
Non plus restricté à 新疆， non c’est en fait partout dans le pays
Les délinquants c’est un phénomène mondial 
Parler d’eux comme il s’agit de absence de droit de l’homme. C’est certainement très très poussé et faux
Par contre les droits humains en Australie ça c’est très très réel 
Les indigènes : c’était des des des plusieurs NATIONS,  AUSSI NOMBREUSES QUE LES PEUPLES D’EUROPE. 
IL YA EU GENOCIDE de plusieurs nations ( prof John Cawte , Vale Professor Cawte ) 
Décrit en detail comment ça c'est passé ( directive de Gouvernance.  Politique soit disant d’assimilation , 
En fait on soustrait les CLANS INDIGENES DE LEUR TERRAINS, 
ON LES oblige à exister dans des dormitoires,  plutôt des cellules en commun. On les rend fou, on jette les malades devant la mer, et on introduit alcool et stupéfiants comme seule moyen de rester  en SOCIALISATION avec les Autres . Voilà ça c’est la vérité de droits humains , jusqu'à présent,  oui il yen a des uncle Tom et des Auntie comment les appeler. 
Ça C’est 1
2. Les arabes c’est le nombre le plus grand qui est séquestré 
On les oblige à manger du porc, autrement les bons médecins à la recours et on injecte les tranquillisant,  les zombies De cette façon pourront manger quoique on leur donne
Et ça je vous le dit 
Without legal prejudice
Mais de mon expérience directe
En même temps
Ces mêmes "" medico? Je ne sais pas comment réussissent 
A écrire les certificats de tans et tans de suicidés 
Vrai ça c’est AUSSIE gulag decaying Tip of 垃圾是非乱的向。


Enfin mes GRIFFES Vous laissent avec ce dernier rayon de soleil
REHABILITATION DES DÉLINQUANTS 
N’EST ce pas la meilleure des solutions adoptées. Par Pékin?

The best possible outcome""
Il ya BRANDING LABELLING, REDUCING les gens , exclure de Cette bonne société des bien intentionnés,  des conditionnés eux mêmes,  en plus de leur nature téméraire ? Aux stupéfiants, aux éthylique 等等
Quelle merveilleuse société 
C’est bien pour eux
Cette dernière griffe, 
Quand le croque-mort les emportera , à travers ciels, vers le Père éternel.. 
Vous les bien intentionnés 
Qui se sont moqués des gens qu’on emmenait 
Ces mêmes gens qui refusent les vaccins 
Voilà ces gens là messieurs. C’est les mêmes gens que ceux qui parlent de choses dont ils n’ont aucune compréhension,  puisque ça ne peut plus penser,

"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move","Laugh to death
Genocide? Go to this country for yourself. It's peaceful there.
What the United States did to the Indians was genocide！"
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",So US boycotting by only sending 18 diplomatics?
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",Wow!!  Not sending diplomats after their contributions 2 years ago.  Boy that telling China what we think of our gift of COVID and human rights.   Really on a roll Democates.

"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",Australia a great country with sky athlet
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move","What real dummy think it's a great idea to send any of their diplomats and regular citizens to a country that they are also preparing to go to war with?

Wouldn't it be a great time to invade Taiwan during the Olympics when there are hundreds if not thousands of athletes in that bubble... which is basically a prison in itself...

 So if the world don't allow China to invade Taiwan, then they can easily hold those people hostage 🧐😒🤔"
"US announces Beijing Winter Olympic diplomatic boycott, China balks at move",That’s just not enough we shouldn’t be allowing our Olympians to head there no way you’ve got to be kidding me
