Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,Gold medal and Olympic ceremony for K baby!!!
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,Kamila Valieva is champion! it's all a policy to discredit Russia at the cost of a child's life
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,"I think we, the rest of the world, are so tired of American propaganda that we might all start throwing up soon... Kamila is doing the triple axel with hands above her head, which, of Iâ€™m not mistaken, is called a Rippon. Adam, be ashamed of your words and be honored that this incredibly talented girl uses that move that is named after you."
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,"Whats shameful is the american media sucking up to the racist  , homophobic , murderous , Islamophobic host of a country. You are morally bankrupt scum who support what China does. SHAME !!!!!"
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,It's unfair for other skaters....
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,Quit crying whiner
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,I adore him
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,Didn't Midori do the Rippon first???
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,I kind of lost sympathy for her when she said it was a mixup between her and her grandpas medication like come on girl. Iâ€™d be pissed if I was that grandpa
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,"Whatever you think about the situation- it's sort of gross that he's smiling and grinning throughout the whole thing. It's an awful situation all around. I get it that he's gleeful that America has a shot at a default team medal but his presentation is very unprofessional. I didn't think Tara and Johnny were nice on their instagrams but that's their own platform. On camera, when commentating, they were appropriate, and not weirdly/creepy/giddy/gleeful about the issue. People knew where they stood personally but they were professional. This guy just seemed so happy about someone else's pain"
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,Whateverâ€™s Adam had done to his face is kindaâ€¦ uncanny valley vibes.
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,"It was a cross contamination with a trace of a drug her grandfather took.  Not enough to affect her but to show up in a trace amount in a test.  The is HUGELY different than someone who took a drug to have an advantage over others.  

Adam Rippon can put his claws away and meow somewhere else.  He is ridiculous.  She was disqualified for the events she skated because the test was positive.  The committee agreed all the evidence pointed to a miniscule cross contamination - which DOES happen.  

She will skate and do so with more athleticism, talent and honor than this twit Rippon could EVER hope to have.  His words will come to haunt him, imo.  Valieva will be the world's greatest skater and Rippon a nobody."
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,"Adam needs his own show, his students are lucky to have him as a coach, but having him as commentator could have been so much fun"
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,She Kari Richardson did not have the funds to pay off the IOC.
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,when i first saw kamila skate last week i was in tears because of how amazing her talent was to me. i was inspired. when the news broke after that i was thinking â€˜how could pills make someone skate like that?â€™ itâ€™s about more than that though after watching her tonight i realized. it didnâ€™t feel right seeing her win first place even though her talent was undeniable with or without cheating. i didnâ€™t want to accept this but itâ€™s not fair.
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,i COMPLETELY agree!!!!!!
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,Ti si tuÅ¾an i zlobanðŸ™„...i jadan!!!!
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,As a russian my first reaction was offensive to Adam Rippon but now I must admit that he is right. Shame on doctors and trainers of Kamila for such irresponsible reaction. Gold medal for Russia is not worth all that hate. Those who really guilty for that doping must have courage to admit their fault and cancel Kamilaâ€™s performance. She will still have enough starts in her future to prove everyone sheâ€™s the best.
Adam Rippon: 'Shameful' to let Kamila Valieva to compete at Winter Games | Olympic Ice | NBC Sports,You are crazy!!!)
