Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics: A high-tech lab for China's vision of the future • FRANCE 24 English,"Organizers, athletes and coaches of the Beijing Winter Olympics should evaluate the good performance of the Winter Olympics. In fact, it's easy for people to be led by their own imagination to biased conclusions they like. So sensational people and the media are popular, but they don't help improve people's intelligence and rationality"

Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics: A high-tech lab for China's vision of the future • FRANCE 24 English,"Big events like this is honeypot for grievances as well as propaganda. No doubt about it, China is using the games as a major propaganda opportunity to showcase its technologies, and above all else, its abilities to host large events without the chaos usually associated with such situation. However, Covid perhaps made it easier to run the show because there is less people to deal with. Equally, Covid also made it tricky to ensure that ALL participants, besides the athletes, arrived safely, and return home safely, free of Covid. 

It is obvious that rigid procedures have to be implemented, it translates into restrictions. Being humans, some see it as a blessing as they no longer have to deal with all the white noises, allowing them to concentrate on what they came to China for, to do well ion their events. As per usual, the knockers are having a field day. Bad foods, too much restrictions, rude volunteers, and of course, the fear of being hacked. The usual witches' brew the West has been hard at stewing for the many years since China becomes a credible competitor to them. 

Judging by the report here, it seems China is using this games as a test run for many new technologies. Unlike many big sporting events like the Olympics, various governments spent big on building grand things, but no longer after the show, those expensive buildings were abandoned. China has proven to be the opposite. It is fully re-using the major facilities such as the Bird Nest Stadium. The full-on 5G technology used in the rail systems will be a prototype for future systems.

On the other side of the coin, America boycotted the games, and constantly snip, bitch and moan about China. What a contrast!"
