"Eileen Gu, the US-born freestyle ski star representing China at the Beijing 2022 Winter Games","Misleading title, she is an American born Chinese. Raised mostly in the States…. Privilege enough to choose between countries pure for her own benefits"
"Eileen Gu, the US-born freestyle ski star representing China at the Beijing 2022 Winter Games","After winning gold for china, Eileen Gu will take all the medals and money earned from chinese endorsements back to US. I bet the thought of being a chinese citizen probably never crosses her mind even for 1 second. And she's probably going to marry some famous white American rather than give a thought of marrying a china man."
"Eileen Gu, the US-born freestyle ski star representing China at the Beijing 2022 Winter Games","She has been representing China since 2016.  But the Americans call her ""traitor"" by now only because she got olympic golds.  So the problem is not on her choice, it is the jealousness of the golds."

"Eileen Gu, the US-born freestyle ski star representing China at the Beijing 2022 Winter Games",if Nathan Chen wants to play for the USA then china should not care... yet they show no coverage of him in china.
