Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva tops leaderboard after figure skating short programme,Doping as a trivial offence nowadays? Shocking!
Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva tops leaderboard after figure skating short programme,"Are they really going to try and claim that this skater accidentally took THREE of her grandfather's heart medication? That's the best excuse her coaches could come up? It's so stupid that it's just another insult to every other clean skater and clean athlete at the games. If she medals there will be no ceremony! So none of the women medalists with get their moment to stand on that podium. Something they work their whole lives for. The Americans won the silver medal in team skating and they don't get their moment because of her and her coaches. It is going to years for skating to recover from this mess they made. It was so simple. If you dope, you are banned."
Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva tops leaderboard after figure skating short programme,"What a talanted 15yo figure skater. Enjoing her performances. Her case is complicated. 1) The sample was from december, and it took 45 days to announce the results while the normal period is 20 days. Just a trace of microdose of the drug, a trace! So , more questions than answers. 2) All other samples are clean. 3) She seem not need any drug. She is young and strong, also it is not an athletic. People love her for the artiscism. ... Also the commete should do their job not pressuring her (without media, without announces), because it is dificult to imagine what damage to her psyche can apply. But despite all of the pressure she showed the highest scores right now."
Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva tops leaderboard after figure skating short programme,why is she competing?…. good or not … cheating is cheating…. 15 years old isn’t a dumb state of mind…

Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva tops leaderboard after figure skating short programme,Funny. Valieva made excuses with her grandfather's drug to avoid disciplinary action. I don't think she deserves an Olympic medal. I feel sorry for the many athletes who trained honestly and participated in the Olympics without doping.
Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva tops leaderboard after figure skating short programme,"I feel poorly for both her and her competitors,... and for all the other athletes who believe in clean sport and true competition. In her case, she has tremendous natural talent, obvious drive and dedication, yet she fell victim to a corrupt system that wants to ensure certain outcomes instead of bringing out the best of their athletes. She was let down by those she thought were supporting her."
Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva tops leaderboard after figure skating short programme,Whatever the story is shes doped and that should be enough to ban her from Olympics. Any excuses are just pathetic. She is not a child and people around her should have guided her to the right way then all this could have not happened. Stop trying to come up with petty excuses really not helping her to grow into a responsible ethical human being. And please think about other athletes who compete with their pure 100% efforts and performances. They worked relentlessly for all their life for this moment just to compete with someone who's doped? This is just so unfair. All the contestants should have just boycotted and let the doped girl skate alone. Worst Olympics ever.
Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva tops leaderboard after figure skating short programme,"Quote from Madisyn Cox's wiki (example of trimetazidine false positive test from contamination):

Cox was banned from competition for six months after a urine sample taken in February 2018 tested positive for trimetazidine. FINA initially reduced her suspension from four years to two years because of Cox's testimony that she did not knowingly ingest the performance-enhancing drug, but would not reduce it further without evidence of the source of the trimetazidine.[8] Upon analysis of both opened and sealed bottles of Cooper Complete Elite Athletic multivitamins, the Court of Arbitration for Sport determined that the multivitamins were the source, and reduced Cox's suspension to six months. The suspension expired on September 3, 2018.[9] However, as United States Swimming World Championship trials occurred during her suspension, Cox was not able to qualify for the 2019 World Aquatics Championships.[10]"
Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva tops leaderboard after figure skating short programme,"My opinion: Any event where winners are debated by people & not by time, is really just a game. To many judgmental rules are involved. This bares no interest at all. But most Olympic events that are use time to dictate the winners are the true sport. That competitive angled edge defines a contest."
