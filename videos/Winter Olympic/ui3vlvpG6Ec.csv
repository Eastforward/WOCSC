Salt Lake City 2002 Opening Ceremony | Salt Lake City 2002 Replays,"That was definitely better than Sochi of 2014. I never really watched it on tv, but on you tube.   Plus I was busy with the horn lesson l, my mom‚Äôs illness and Teddy the labradoodle. And it never really came to my mind that the dominant skaters were Asians and Russians. I did watch the Olympics of 2002 and other figure skating championships on tv.  My mom loved Ice skating as a child.  I took ice skating too until I had problems with arthritis and my spine.  You know it‚Äôs hard to skate with arthritis."
