Les pays participants du boycott diplomatique sont marginalisés. Ils se comptent avec les doigts d'une main. Une trentaine de Chefs d'Etat et de Gouvernement sont présents à la Tribune des JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022. Poutine en est la vedette. Sont présents à la Tribune: le Secrétaire Général des Nations Unies, le Grand Duc Henri du Luxembourg, le Prince Albert II de Monaco, le Président de la Pologne et le Président de la Serbie. Aux JO d'hiver de Beijing 2022 la Chine et la Russie s'affichent ensemble pour montrer le nouvel ordre mondial. Sans BIDEN. La Russie a reçu le soutien de la Chine en ce qui concerne les préoccupations raisonnables de la Russie. La Russie et la Chine s'opposent à l'expansion future de l'OTAN. L'occident doit empêcher l'humoriste d'Ukraine d'allumer le feu de la troisième guerre mondiale. Un ouïghour porte la flamme olympique pour dénoncer les tissus de mensonge occidentaux sur les ouïghours. Un coup de pied au cul des journalistes des télévisions menteuses occidentales. Une paire de gifles aux députés français votant la résolution sur les ouïghours.-

BIDEN (and his allies) is declared Persona Non Grata at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The countries participating in the diplomatic boycott are marginalized. They can be counted with the fingers of one hand. About thirty Heads of State and Government are present at the Tribune of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Putin is the star. Present at the Tribune are: Secretary-General of the United Nations, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Prince Albert II of Monaco, the President of Poland and the President of Serbia. At the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, China and Russia are coming together to show the new world order. Without BIDEN. Russia has received China's support regarding Russia's reasonable concerns. Russia and China oppose NATO's future expansion. The West must prevent the comedian from Ukraine from lighting the fire of World War III. A Uyghur carries the Olympic flame to denounce Western fabrics of lies about Uighurs. A kick in the ass of Western lying TV journalists. A pair of slaps to French MPs voting for the resolution on the Uyghurs.!!"

IF ""Chinese Lunnar New Year"" is correct,
Is the example below correct? 

Israel Merry Christmas ?!?!??
Europe Thanksgiving Day ?!?!??
USA Black Friday ?!?!??Most People said “NO“ 

Just as Merry Christmas has become common all over the world,
Of course, it's just ""Lunar New Year"" in Asia. 

Mongolia, Vietnam, Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Singapore, etc. 

""Lunar New Year"" is a Big-Holiday in many Asian countries.
This is because,
In the past, Many Asian Countries used the lunar calendar. 

China thinks that the Chinese created all world cultures.
This is called the 'Chinese Fundamental Theory'. 

China claims that the Chinese also made hockey, bowling, pizza, kimchi, and so on. 

But, it is 'FACT' that
Bowling is the origin of Egypt, Pizza is the origin of Italy, and KimChi is a traditional Korean food. 

Do you know “China Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution” ??? 

From 1966 to 1976, During 10 years,
Chinese ‘burned’ their own culture after China became communist. 

From an Anti-communist point of view, it is also a case frequently mentioned when explaining why communism should not be practiced. 

Anyway,
At that time, “Many Chinese Cultures“ burned down because China burned its own culture. 

SO Nowadays, that is reason why China is jealous of the world. 

Therefore,
China has been trying to steal especial ’the popular culture of other countries’.
It is in the same context as China's illegal copying of trademarks and intellectual property rights. 

Many people in the world cannot understand China sometimes.
But it is very bad! 

What do you think about it ???"
