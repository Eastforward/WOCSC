Jon Montgomery Wins Mens Skeleton Gold - Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics,Damn that ass jiggles.
Jon Montgomery Wins Mens Skeleton Gold - Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics,"I'm confused a bit.  He says there is no steering mechanism, then comments a bit later about how hitting the wall cost him....

So either they can steer and avoid the wall....or ?

I assume maybe the announcer just means the sled itself has no mechanism but that the rider can steer with body weight maybe?

If that's the case than the athlete IS the steering mechanism......and he's what trying to infer they have no control....

Don't get me wrong, either this shit is nutty :P  However being intentionally misleading is bad.....and if it wasn't intentional he needs more experience casting....then again maybe that is why he is casting the Skeleton"
