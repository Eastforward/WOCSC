NBA player calls for boycott of Beijing Winter Olympic Games,"I don't understand China, sometimes. 

IF ""Chinese Lunnar New Year"" is correct,
Is the example below correct? 

Israel Merry Christmas ?!?!??
Europe Thanksgiving Day ?!?!??
USA Black Friday ?!?!??Most People said ‚ÄúNO‚Äú 

Just as Merry Christmas has become common all over the world,
Of course, it's just ""Lunar New Year"" in Asia. 

Mongolia, Vietnam, Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Singapore, etc. 

""Lunar New Year"" is a Big-Holiday in many Asian countries.
This is because,
In the past, Many Asian Countries used the lunar calendar. 

China thinks that the Chinese created all world cultures.
This is called the 'Chinese Fundamental Theory'. 

China claims that the Chinese also made hockey, bowling, pizza, kimchi, and so on. 

But, it is 'FACT' that
Bowling is the origin of Egypt, Pizza is the origin of Italy, and KimChi is a traditional Korean food. 

Do you know ‚ÄúChina Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution‚Äù ??? 

From 1966 to 1976, During 10 years,
Chinese ‚Äòburned‚Äô their own culture after China became communist. 

From an Anti-communist point of view, it is also a case frequently mentioned when explaining why communism should not be practiced. 

Anyway,
At that time, ‚ÄúMany Chinese Cultures‚Äú burned down because China burned its own culture. 

SO Nowadays, that is reason why China is jealous of the world. 

Therefore,
China has been trying to steal especial ‚Äôthe popular culture of other countries‚Äô.
It is in the same context as China's illegal copying of trademarks and intellectual property rights. 

Many people in the world cannot understand China sometimes.
But it is very bad! 

What do you think about it ???"
NBA player calls for boycott of Beijing Winter Olympic Games,"One of the simplest numerical comparisons.

1. between 1949 (when the CPC came to power) and 2020, the Uyghur population of Xinjiang increased from 2 million to 12 million.

2, In the past 300 years, the Indian population in the United States, from millions, has decreased to a few hundred thousand. Indians in the whole America, from tens of millions of people, down to hundreds of thousands of people.

This figure is the best comparison."
NBA player calls for boycott of Beijing Winter Olympic Games,I wonder if Mr. Kanter has ever visited China?
NBA player calls for boycott of Beijing Winter Olympic Games,Enes Kanter is my man! He is my hero! We need more of him and less of Lebron and MJ. What an amazing human being! I will rank him up there with Gandhi and MLK. A true hero of heroes! Boston should be happy to have a man of such stature speaking his mind. He is absolutely right! Lebron is greedy for more and more and more. Using China for the billions of people. MJ what have YOU done for your brothers and sisters in the ghetto? Selling kids shoes that parents can NOT afford and kids dying for the shoes? Shame on you! Black on black crime! What did you do in Chicago MJ? Black on black crime and gangs are taking south side Chicago! Go Kanter! YOU are beautiful! YOU are amazing!
